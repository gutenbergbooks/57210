<h3>

</h3>

<p>
On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in
the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in
the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded
subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself
against the end of a cross seat, opened his paper.  But
this morning, like everybody else in the train, he
approached the headlines with an unusual thrill of
interest, for an immense sensation was in process of being
unrolled in the press.
</p>

<p>
Two days before, Silas Gyde, the millionaire miser
and usurer, had been blown to pieces in the street by
a bomb.  The assassin, arrested, proved to be not one
of those who had a grievance against the old money
lender (there were supposed to be many such) but a
maniac of anarchistic proclivities.  His name was Emil
Jansen.  He was already on the way to an asylum for
the criminal insane.
</p>

<p>
The main facts of the case having been given in
previous issues, space in the paper to-day was largely
devoted to anecdotes illustrating the extraordinary
eccentricities of the dead man.  It was said that with an
income of perhaps six millions a year, he spent no more
than six hundred.  He bought his clothes at an immigrant
outfitters' on Washington street, and even so had
not had a new suit in two years.  To keep himself from
spending money it was his habit to go about with empty
pockets, and borrow what few cents he needed from
bootblacks, newsboys and applewomen to whom he was
well known.  But he was scrupulous in repaying these
debts.  Every day, even when he had become old and
feeble, he turned up at the office of a certain
corporation for the sake of a free lunch provided to the
directors, though he had to walk a mile from the Wall
street district where all his business was transacted.  It
was at the door of this office that he had met his end.
And so on.  And so on.
</p>

<p>
Silas Gyde died a bachelor, and had left no kin so
far as was known.  His wealth was said to be well in
excess of a hundred million dollars.  The paper gave
a tempting list of the gilt-edge securities he was
supposed to own; but nothing was known for sure, for
though continually engaged in litigation, he had left
no personal attorney; he had not sufficiently trusted
any man.  No one could say, now, where he had kept
his wealth or how he had intended to dispose of it.
</p>

<p>
Young Jack Norman read of the millions with the
kind of aching gusto that a hungry man pictures a good
dinner.  Jack's earnings were twelve dollars a week.
He knew little about sociology or economics, but he
could not but feel a dim dissatisfaction with the scheme
of things that restricted him, with all a youth's capacity
for living largely, to twelve dollars weekly, while it
provided the old man with the tastes of a hermit crab,
with a hundred thousand.
</p>

<p>
Twelve dollars a week meant that Jack's still boyish
appetite daily had to be less than satisfied by the fare
of a second rate boarding house; it meant that he had
to wear cheap clothes when the instinct of his years
was to array himself like Solomon; it meant that his
lip must curl with envy as the pleasures of the town
passed him by; hardest of all to bear, it meant that the
joys of honorable courtship were denied him.  A fellow
must have money to take a girl out in town.
</p>

<p>
Jack's case was not peculiar.  The same expression
of sullen wistfulness might have been read in many a
young face on the same train.  What distinguished this
face from the others was a latent fire in the eyes which
suggested that, given the opportunity, the possessor
had the capacity to play a larger part in life than
twelve dollars a week permitted.
</p>

<p>
He got off at Worth street and made his way East
to Centre where he worked as book-keeper in Fisher's
sash and blind factory.  Walking the street, like many
another young head that morning, his was light with
dreams.
</p>

<p>
"If I had Silas Gyde's money I wouldn't be pounding
the concrete like this.  I'd be fluffing down to Wall
street in my Rolls-Royce.  Or my yacht would be
putting me ashore at the Battery.  Or a special train up
from Lakewood.  First thing I'd do would be to tell
Fisher to go to Hell.  Oh, that would be worth a
million!
</p>

<p>
"I'd say to Fisher: 'Who do you think you are, you
little two-spot bankrupt carpenter with your business
in your wife's name!  One would think you were
William K. Astorbilt, the airs you give yourself.  Why
I could buy you out for the price of what I spend for
a meal!'"
</p>

<p>
As he turned in at the door of Fisher's place Jack's
eyes involuntarily sought a window in the establishment
of the hardware jobber opposite.  As present the
window was tenantless; later it would be sanctified by
a chestnut head bending over a typewriter.  Jack's
dreams were diverted into another channel.
</p>

<p>
"If I had Silas Gyde's money she wouldn't have to
pay for her own lunch when she eats with me.  And
I could take her out nights.  Oh!  Automobile, dress-suit,
box seats at the Opera, supper at the Bienvenu
and a dance!  Lord!  And they say old Gyde lived on
my salary!"
</p>

<p>
The offices of the Fisher factory were on the second
floor.  As Jack turned in from the hall, Fisher himself
was standing at the door of his private office; hands in
pockets, cigar rolling between thick lips, hat on the
back of his head, on his face the customary brutal
sneer.
</p>

<p>
"You're late!" he rasped.  "Can't you get out of bed
in the mornings?"
</p>

<p>
This was a regular performance at Fisher's.  The
boss took his pleasure that way, and the office
employees were hardened to it.  But at the moment Jack
was exalted.  In his imagination he was still the master
of millions.
</p>

<p>
"The clock's fast," he said curtly, meeting Fisher
square in the eye.
</p>

<p>
"You lie!" said that gentleman.
</p>

<p>
By way of answer Jack pulled out his watch and
compared it with the wall clock.  The glance was not
complimentary to Fisher's battered time-piece.  Fisher
purpled with rage.
</p>

<p>
"You &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;!  Don't give me any of your lip!"
</p>

<p>
"Who do you think you are?" said Jack coolly.  The
words were fatally ready to his tongue.  "You little
two-by-four sash and blind maker with your business
in your wife's name!  Better pay your bills before you
talk that way to honest men!"
</p>

<p>
Behind the fright in the eyes of the thin office-boy
and the pale typist, gleamed a wondering delight.
Never had such words been heard in that place!
</p>

<p>
"Get out of here!  Get out of here!" roared Fisher
on the verge of apoplexy.  "Get out before I throw
you out!"
</p>

<p>
"As to that," said Jack, "you're not man enough,"
and he took a step nearer the boss.
</p>

<p>
Fisher precipitately retired into his private office,
slamming the door behind him.  The office boy tittered,
and clapped a scared hand over his mouth.  Jack
turned on his heel, and coolly lit a cigarette&mdash;lit it and
blew a whole cloud of smoke, there in those sacred
precincts!  The eyes of the other two regarded him
with a kind of adoration.
</p>

<p>
From behind the partition Fisher was still shouting:
"Get out!  You're fired!"
</p>

<p>
"Much obliged," said Jack.  "It was worth it."
</p>

<p>
But even while he spake the brave words his heart
was sinking like a stone in deep water.  It was
Wednesday, and his salary was always spent in advance of
course.  All he possessed in the world was a dollar
twenty and his watch&mdash;fortunately out of hock for
the time being.  By this time, he thought Fisher was
probably sorry too, and would take him back at a
word of contrition&mdash;but with those admiring eyes on
him, he could not speak it.
</p>

<p>
"So long, Kids," he said airily, and started for the
door.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, wait a minute," said the boy.  "Here's a letter
for you this morning."
</p>

<p>
Jack thrust it carelessly into his pocket and went on
down-stairs.  At the street door he stopped at a loss.
Turned loose on the street at nine o'clock of a working
morning, which way was one to turn?  He glanced
across the street again, the window was still vacant.
Anyway, he couldn't very well see her, jobless as he
was.  Better just drop of sight.  This thought cost
him a shrewd pang.  He started walking quickly in
the direction opposite to that whence she would
presently come.
</p>

<p>
He remembered the letter and took it out.  Letters
were not so frequent in his life that he could
afford to disdain them.  This was a business envelope,
large, square, and made of thick, fine paper.  "National
New York Bank" was neatly embossed on the flap.  It
was addressed in long-hand, an untidy but powerful
scrawl.
</p>

<p>
"Some high-class ad," thought Jack.  "Want to sell
me bonds, I suppose."  He chuckled with bitter humor.
</p>

<p>
Inside he found this communication in the same
hand:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"Dear Mr. Norman:
</p>

<p>
"Will you please call me up at my office to-morrow
morning.  I shall arrive there about nine-thirty.  The
number of my private phone is &mdash;&mdash; Broad.  You will
not find it in the book.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Very truly yours,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walter Delamare."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Jack, being a true American youth, regarded this
skeptically.  "What kind of a con is he handing me?"
he thought.  "Who the deuce is Walter Delamare?"
</p>

<p>
The name rang familiarly in his ears.  He glanced at
the note head again.  Under the name of the bank
was printed: "Office of the President."  Of course!
Walter Delamare, President of the National New
York Bank.  His name was in the papers every day.
It wielded a magic influence in the nation.
</p>

<p>
Jack still suspected a hoax of some kind, though
the expensive note paper and the scrawly, characteristic
hand were impressive.  He examined the latter with
fresh care.  It was surely real handwriting, not process
work.
</p>

<p>
"Oh well, it's worth a nickel for a telephone call,"
he thought.  "I have nothing to lose."
</p>

<p>
He had nearly half an hour to kill before nine-thirty,
and no twenty-five minutes ever passed more slowly.
He walked down to Wall street and had a look at the
outside of the National New York Bank, an imposing
colonnade a whole block long.  He circumnavigated it
three times, and at nine thirty-one, precisely, went into
a cigar store and called up the number that had been
given him.
</p>

<p>
After a due interval he heard a voice at the other
end of the wire that certainly sounded like that of a
man of mark&mdash;crisp, serene, potent; humorous and
kindly, too.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Norman?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"This is Delamare.  You are prompt.  Can you
come down to see me this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Can you come right away?  Later I shall be very
busy."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Better taxi down.  And by the way, it
would be better if you sent in an assumed name.  I will
explain why when I see you.  Call yourself&mdash;let me
see&mdash;call yourself Mr. Robinson."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  I shall be expecting you.  Good-by."
</p>

<p>
Jack issued from the telephone booth a little dazed.
A great captain of finance asking him, the humble
bookkeeper, to call!  Putting Jack on an equal footing
by referring to himself as "Delamare"!  A mystery
suggested by the use of an assumed name!  What could
it all mean!  On the one hand the skeptic in Jack
whispered: "Some one is putting up a game on you!"  On
the other hand the dear hidden ego in us all that
only needs a little appreciation to show its head said:
"Why shouldn't Walter Delamare have private business
with you as well as anybody?"
</p>

<p>
Jack had only to walk across the street to the bank.
The argument within him showed itself in a kind of
defiant sheepishness as he passed the great portal and
found himself under the far-flung vaulted ceiling.  It
had been designed to impress, and impressive it was.
With its rare marbles and mural paintings it was more
like a palace than a place of sober business.  It was
not yet the opening hour, but many elegant clerks were
already starting to work behind the brass grills.  Shabby
Jack eyed their cravats and fine linen wistfully.
</p>

<p>
He asked one of the uniformed attendants the way
to Mr. Delamare's office, half expecting a roar of
laughter to go up.  But nothing of the sort occurred.
He next found himself opposed by a silvery-haired old
gentleman whose exquisite courtesy was the same to all.
</p>

<p>
"Whom do you wish to see?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Delamare."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Delamare can be seen only by appointment."
</p>

<p>
"I have an appointment."
</p>

<p>
The courteous old gentleman permitted himself a
glance of surprise.  "What name shall I say?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Robinson."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir."
</p>

<p>
He returned with an air of slightly heightened respect.
"Please step this way, sir."
</p>

<p>
"It is all right," thought Jack.  "Nobody is hoaxing me."
</p>

<p>
He followed his conductor down a mahogany and
plate glass corridor.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Jack was introduced to a room of truly noble
proportions, vast and high, with a row of tall windows
with round tops, looking down a narrow street to
the harbor.  In the center was a flat-topped desk as
big as a banquet board and behind it sat a man,
dwarfed in size by the vastness of his surroundings&mdash;but
immeasurably increased in significance.  The whole
place focused in him.
</p>

<p>
Jack's silken-tongued conductor announced him, and
softly withdrew.  The man at the desk raised his head
and bent a look of strong interest and quizzical
amusement on Jack.  It was the face of a man well-assured
of his place in the world; serene and careless; a man
who consorted on equal terms with labor leaders and
kings.
</p>

<p>
"So this is what you're like!" he said.
</p>

<p>
The unexpected look of interest and the strange
words instead of heartening Jack had the contrary
effect.  His knees shook under him a little, his mouth
went dry.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," said Mr. Delamare, indicating a chair
opposite him.
</p>

<p>
Jack obeyed, walking jerkily like an automaton.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you're wondering why I sent for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You have no idea?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you as soon as you have answered a few
questions.  I must make sure first that I have got hold
of the right man."
</p>

<p>
He pulled out a drawer, and taking from it a
typewritten sheet, read his question from it.
</p>

<p>
"Your full name?"
</p>

<p>
"John Farrow Norman."
</p>

<p>
"Parents living?"
</p>

<p>
"Both dead, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Father's name?"
</p>

<p>
"John Goadby Norman."
</p>

<p>
"Mother's name?"
</p>

<p>
"Phoebe Farrow."
</p>

<p>
"Place of your birth?"
</p>

<p>
"Cartonsville, New York."
</p>

<p>
There were other questions of a similar tenor, and
Jack's answers were apparently satisfactory to
Mr. Delamare.  He folded the paper, and searched in the
drawer for something else.  His next question was an
odd one.
</p>

<p>
"Are you wearing your father's watch?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes," stammered Jack.
</p>

<p>
It was the one article of value that he possessed.
He unhooked it from its chain and passed it over.
The banker opened the back of the case as if aware
of what was to be found there, and the smiling face
of Jack's mother as a bride was revealed.  From the
drawer he took an old-fashioned cabinet photograph,
and compared it with the picture in the watch case.
</p>

<p>
Jack catching sight of the second picture was startled
out of his diffidence.  "My mother's picture!  Where
did you get that?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Delamare showed him the two faces side by
side.  "Not the same photograph, but unquestionably
the same woman.  You may have both now."
</p>

<p>
He handed them over.  The picture he had taken
from the drawer showed Jack's mother at an earlier
period, just graduating into womanhood with all the
touching innocence of youth about her.  Jack's eyes
filled.
</p>

<p>
"What does it mean?" he murmured.
</p>

<p>
"One more question," said Mr. Delamare.  "Give
me a brief account of yourself as far back as you can
remember."
</p>

<p>
Jack did so, wonderingly, and the banker checked
his story with another typewritten sheet that he held.
</p>

<p>
"That will do," he said at last.  "I'm satisfied."
</p>

<p>
"How did you learn all this?" asked Jack.  "I didn't
think anybody in the world was interested what jobs
I had or where I lived."
</p>

<p>
"One never knows," was the smiling answer.  "Write
your name and I'll tell you."
</p>

<p>
Jack obeyed.  The banker compared it with a signature
he had.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," he said.  "How would you like to be rich?"
</p>

<p>
Jack stared at him in a daze.
</p>

<p>
Delamare laughed.  "Rich beyond the dreams of
avarice!  Worth eighty million dollars in fact."
</p>

<p>
"Eighty million!" muttered Jack stupidly.
</p>

<p>
"As you sit there this minute you are worth eighty
million&mdash;perhaps more."
</p>

<p>
"Where&mdash;did I get it?" stammered Jack helplessly.
</p>

<p>
"Silas Gyde bequeathed you all he possessed."
</p>

<p>
Jack's face was a study in amazement, incredulity&mdash;not
to say downright alarm.  At the sight Mr. Delamare
threw back his head and laughed a peal.
</p>

<p>
"Don't take it so hard!  You'll live it down!"
</p>

<p>
"What was I to Silas Gyde?" murmured Jack.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know the whole story.  Mr. Gyde took no
man on earth into his confidence.  I judge, though,
that he was an unsuccessful suitor for your mother.
The affair must have cut deep, for he never married."
</p>

<p>
"Eighty million!" murmured Jack, unable to grasp
the idea of such a sum.
</p>

<p>
"Nearly five million a year; four hundred thousand
a month; say thirteen thousand a day."
</p>

<p>
The figures had a convincing ring.  The color stole
back into Jack's cheeks, and a delicious warmth crept
around his heart.  He had no great difficulty in
believing his good fortune, because he had already pictured
it to himself in fancy.  His first thought was of Kate.
"I can buy her anything now!"
</p>

<p>
For a moment or two he found nothing to say.
Delamare seeing his eyes become dreamy, smiled again.
"Spending it already, I see!"
</p>

<p>
Jack blushed and descended to earth.  "Please tell
me all about it," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you what I know.  As I said, I was not
in Mr. Gyde's full confidence&mdash;no man was.  Indeed
I knew him but slightly.  He was a good customer of
the bank, but he did everything in his own peculiar
way.  He rented a large vault from us, and had the
locks changed under his own supervision.  I believe
he kept the major part of his securities there, but he
may have other vaults too.
</p>

<p>
"Some five years or so ago, he came to me saying
he wanted to rent a small lock box in our vaults, the
kind that we get ten dollars a year for.  He was so
insistent upon the necessity for secrecy that we allowed
him to have it under an assumed name.  Another
officer of the bank and myself were taken into the secret.
Mr. Gyde left me a duplicate key to this box with
instructions to open it if ever a day passed without my
hearing from him.  I believe he used to visit the box
himself to make sure that I had not been tampering
with it, but his peculiarities were so well known, one
didn't mind that in him.
</p>

<p>
"Since then, every day of his life he dropped in here,
or called me or my secretary on the phone, just to
report, he said.  In the beginning I often wondered
why he had set himself such a task, but as time went
on it became a mere form, and at last I forgot how the
custom had started.
</p>

<p>
"When word of his death was brought me day
before yesterday, all recollection of the small box had
passed from my mind.  My secretary brought it back
by remarking that the old gentleman's daily report was
now at an end.  I found the keys and opened the box.
The papers were sealed into the box itself, so that
they could not be removed without breaking the wax.
Very characteristic of Mr. Gyde.
</p>

<p>
"The contents consisted of his will; detailed
instructions to me how to find you and identify you, and
several keys which I was directed to hand you.  Here
they are.  And here is the will, a model of clearness
and brevity you see."
</p>

<p>
Jack read: "I, Silas Gyde, being of sound mind and
in the full possession of my senses, do hereby devise
and bequeath all that I die possessed of to John
Farrow Norman, son of John Goadby Norman and
Phoebe Farrow, and do appoint the said John Farrow
Norman and Walter Delamare, President of the
National New York Bank, my executors."
</p>

<p>
"My instructions state," Mr. Delamare resumed,
"that the witnesses to the will were two clerks employed
by Mr. Gyde at that time.  You see he forgot nothing.
</p>

<p>
"As to those keys, they are for the various doors
in Mr. Gyde's apartment at the Hotel Madagascar.  I
am told here not to deliver them into any hands but
yours, and you are instructed to visit the apartment
at once, and alone.  Always mysterious, you see.  By
the way, Mr. Gyde was the sole owner of the
Madagascar, and it is therefor now yours."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose there will be lawyers to see, and so on,"
said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Gyde had no personal attorneys.  He was
always suing and being sued, but he retained a new
man for every case.  Obviously he has made these
arrangements on his own initiative.  I expect it will
be up to you and me to ferret out his properties.  I will
have my attorney probate the will.  You had better
have a lawyer to advise you.  Have you any one in
mind?"
</p>

<p>
Jack shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, I will give you a note to a friend of mine
for whose integrity and ability I will vouch.  His name
is Hugh Brome.  He is young like yourself, and this
matter will mean a big thing for him&mdash;that is if you
have no objection to his youth?"
</p>

<p>
"No indeed!" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Delamare wrote a note and handed it over.
"Go and look him over before you commit yourself.
If you approve of him the three of us can have a talk
here later."
</p>

<p>
Jack rose.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you forgotten something?" asked Mr. Delamare
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"What?" said Jack blankly.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;some money?"
</p>

<p>
Jack blushed.  "I didn't think I could get any yet."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly!  As much as you want.  Mr. Gyde left
a large balance here.  Of course I can't hand that
over to you yet, but the bank is prepared to advance
you whatever you require.  The bank hopes that you
will continue to favor it with your patronage."
</p>

<p>
More than anything Mr. Delamare had said, this
last little sentence made Jack feel like a millionaire.
</p>

<p>
"Here's a pocket check book.  Make out your check
and I'll send it to the teller with my O.K.  You don't
want to go out there yourself for the reporters are
lying in wait for you.  That's why I told you to send
in an assumed name.  They pester the life out of me.
As soon as you're safely out of the way I'll give out
the story and be rid of them."
</p>

<p>
Jack took the offered pen and wrote his check, the
banker watching him with a smile.  At the line for
the amount Jack stuck; he thought of a hundred
dollars, five hundred, a thousand; higher than a thousand
he dared not go.
</p>

<p>
"Is that too much?" he asked, gasping a little.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all!" said Mr. Delamare, laughing.  "Merely
your income for about half an hour!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>
So Jack Norman came out of the National New
York Bank eighty millions richer than he went in.
He left the building walking on air, and being
unaccustomed to that form of exercise it is not surprising
that he staggered a little, and collided with more than
one matter-of-fact Wall Street figure.  A delightful
insane phantasmagoria whirled through his brain,
blinding him to his earthly surroundings.  He walked
five blocks before he had the least idea where he was
going.  Here a wild taxi-cab almost ran him down, and
he was brought back to earth with a bump.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord! suppose I'd been laid out before I
had a chance to spend a dollar!" he thought with
horror.
</p>

<p>
He looked at his watch.  It was only half-past ten.
It had taken him less than an hour to acquire eighty
millions.  An hour and a half must still pass before
he could satisfy his great need of telling Kate what
had happened&mdash;that is unless he descended on her
office and carried her off bodily in a taxi-cab, like young
Lochinvar.  But he was doubtful how Kate would
take this.  He was a little afraid of Kate.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime he had to see his lawyer.  But he
couldn't very well go and ask a man to take charge
of an eighty million dollar estate while he looked like
a tramp.  Clothes!&mdash;enchanting thought; he was able
to buy anything in New York that caught his fancy.  It
need not be supposed that the fair sex enjoys a
monopoly of this passion; the young male, being more
restricted in his choice, brings to it a deeper, more
concentrated passion.  The difference in shirt patterns!
The design of a cravat of which only four square inches
is shown!
</p>

<p>
He retreated into the shelter of a doorway to
consider this matter, watching the passers-by meanwhile
for inspiration.  But he did not see what he wanted.
The young men looked either grubby or flash.  Jack
discovered that he had a definite taste in clothes that
he had never been able to indulge.
</p>

<p>
He was aware of course of the subtle differences
between ready-made and made-to-order.  But while
he took the time to search out the best tailor in New
York he had to have something.  Dimly he remembered
having heard of a fine old firm that outfitted
men from top to toe.  It was on Madison avenue.  He
looked about for the nearest subway station, and then
remembered with a delightful start that there were
such things as taxi-cabs in the world, and his pocket
was full of money.
</p>

<p>
He held up a negligent finger to a passing cab.  He
got in and, leaning back luxuriously, wondered how the
people who looked at him would look if they knew!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At a few minutes before noon, an elegantly dressed
young fellow, conspicuous for his graceful figure and
sparkling brown eyes, was walking nervously up and
down Centre street; ten paces each way and back.  A
taxi-cab waited at the curb beside him.  In one hand
the young man carried a pair of yellow chamois gloves,
and swung a yellow malacca stick in the other.  He
wore a boutonnière of corn-flowers.
</p>

<p>
As he waited his nervousness increased.  It suddenly
occurred to him that to greet Kate with a flourish of
the new Fedora, and hand her into the waiting taxi
might create a scandal in the eyes of her fellow
workers.  Indeed he was not at all sure but that she might
turn him down flat.  At the same time he began to
worry about the yellow gloves and the yellow stick&mdash;a
thought too conspicuous for Centre street, perhaps.
</p>

<p>
Finally he went to the cab and, unobtrusively dropping
the stick inside, paid the man off and let him go.
He then thrust the gloves and the boutonnière in his
pocket, and felt much better.
</p>

<p>
When Kate finally did come down-stairs, her first
glance overlooked the new clothes entirely, and went
straight to his eyes.  Seeing the beaming smile there,
her eyes fell demurely.  Then did she perceive the
finery from the feet up, but was too well bred to make
any comment.  Jack was obliged to ask her very off-hand:
</p>

<p>
"Notice any change?"
</p>

<p>
"You look very nice to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I got tired going round like a rag-picker!"
</p>

<p>
She made no further remark, and Jack who had
counted on creating more of an effect than this, felt
a little aggrieved.  You never could get any change out
of this girl, he reflected.  But just let her wait!  She
was due to be surprised for once in her young life!
</p>

<p>
At the corner he held her in talk for a moment,
while he searched for a taxi out of the tail of his eye.
</p>

<p>
"Let's not go to Geiger's to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Geiger's is all right."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sick of the joint!"
</p>

<p>
"It's as good as any of the places around here."
</p>

<p>
"Let's go down-town."
</p>

<p>
"But you know I only have an hour."
</p>

<p>
A taxi came bowling through from the Bowery with
its little "vacant" flag raised.  Jack held up a finger.
It drew up beside them with squealing brakes, and
the chauffeur opened the door.  Kate who had not
observed Jack's signal, turned her back on it.
</p>

<p>
"Get in," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
That was when she received her first shock.  Her
eyes opened very wide.  "Why, Mr. Norman!"
she began.
</p>

<p>
"Get in!" said Jack so peremptorily, that in her
state of fluster she actually obeyed.
</p>

<p>
"Café Savarin," said Jack to the chauffeur.
</p>

<p>
The cab started with a jerk, throwing them back on
the cushions.  "Let me out!" she said&mdash;but not very
strongly.
</p>

<p>
He affected not to hear.  There was a delicious
satisfaction in seeing the self-possessed little lady
overcome with confusion, if only for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow I'll come for you in my own car," he
said, nonchalantly.
</p>

<p>
"Are you crazy?" she murmured, really alarmed.
</p>

<p>
He laughed.  "Can't I have a car as well as anybody?"
</p>

<p>
"But I thought&mdash;that is&mdash;you always said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That I was as poor as Job's turkey, eh?  Only
a stall.  I just worked for Fisher for the sociological
experience.  I don't have to work really."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with troubled eyes.
</p>

<p>
He couldn't resist the temptation to tease her a
little.  "My old man's a multi-millionaire," he rattled
on.  "Of course I get sick of that life sometimes, and
scout about a bit."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes became so reproachful his heart smote him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's only a joke," he said quickly.  "Lord
knows the poverty was real enough&mdash;but it's over for
good!"  "For both of us," he would have liked to add,
but did not quite dare.  "Look!" he cried, drawing his
hand out of his pocket with the great roll of
yellow-backed bills.  "My income for half an hour!"
</p>

<p>
"Where did you get it?" she said aghast
</p>

<p>
He laughed again.  "Honest, I didn't steal it."
</p>

<p>
"Please!"
</p>

<p>
He told her at last.  The story sounded strange in
his own ears.  When he came to the end he saw to his
astonishment that there were tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;why, what's the matter?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she said smiling through the rain.
"Am I not silly?  But I suppose it means change.  And
I hate changes!"
</p>

<p>
"A change for the better, only.  If you knew how I
hated poverty!"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes dropped.  "I, too," that meant, but she
did not care to tell him so, audibly.
</p>

<p>
"If you knew how mean I felt every day when we
went to that beanery together, and you had to pay for
your own lunch!"
</p>

<p>
"But what was the difference?  We both work for
our living."
</p>

<p>
"A man feels differently.  Why I never would ask
you if I could come to see you in the evenings, because
I couldn't take you out anywhere.  I was afraid I
couldn't keep my end up with your gang."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't any gang," she murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Well all that's ended now!  Now there's no limit
but the sky!  And here we are.  The lawyer guy told
me this was the swellest place down-town."
</p>

<p>
A fresh panic seized her.  "I can't eat in a place
like this!  I'm not fit to be seen!"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!  You always look like a lady!"
</p>

<p>
Circumstances were too strong for her.  She found
herself being wafted across the sidewalk, and was
delivered into the hands of the maid in the lobby,
before she could think of an effective resistance.
Indeed they were seated at a snowy little board
brightened by an electric candle, before she really got her
breath.  At Jack's elbow stood a post-graduate waiter
with a deferential bend in his back, and at just the right
distance an orchestra was discussing the <i>Meditation</i>
from <i>Thaïs</i>.
</p>

<p>
A sigh escaped Kate, for after all she was a
perfectly human girl.  "Oh, this is heavenly!"
</p>

<p>
Jack's eyes sparkled.  "Good!  I was wondering
when you'd begin to let yourself go."  He leaned
forward.  "You should worry!  You're the prettiest girl
here&mdash;and the best dressed!"
</p>

<p>
Which was true&mdash;on both counts.  There was no
doubt about her prettiness; Heaven had attended to
that.  Eyes of the deepest blue with a glance steady
and deep; an adorable little nose, and a mouth at once
firm and most kissable.  As for her clothes, it may be
they were of cheap materials, but the taste that had
chosen redeemed them.  The hat, most important
item, was of Kate's own manufacture, being copied
from the window of a milliner whose name is a
household word.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly," said the wearer severely.  "The
waiter is waiting."
</p>

<p>
"That's what he's here for!  Oh, dear!  I wish we
could stay all afternoon!"
</p>

<p>
This was put forth really as a proposal rather than
a wish.  But Kate was relentless.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to hurry," she said firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we've time for a cup of green turtle, a lobster
paté and a coupe St. Jacques," said Jack.  A whispered
order was added, and one of the yellow backs changed
hands.  The waiter departed.
</p>

<p>
"One would think you had been coming here all
your life," said Kate demurely.
</p>

<p>
This was delicious flattery.  "I've planned it in
dreams," he said.
</p>

<p>
Presently the waiter returned, smiling from ear
to ear, and bearing a bunch of violets almost as big
as a cart wheel.  Their delicious fragrance filled all
the air.  With a flourish he placed them before Kate.
</p>

<p>
She gasped.  "Oh!  How wonderful!  For me!"
</p>

<p>
"Who do you think?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but what shall I do with them?"
</p>

<p>
"Put them on.  Any woman can wear violets without
hurting."
</p>

<p>
"But what will they think when I get back to the
office."
</p>

<p>
"The worst!" said Jack solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Norman!"
</p>

<p>
"Why go back to the office?" asked Jack very offhand.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Norman!" she said again, with a scandalized air.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Jack," he said unabashed.
</p>

<p>
She made believe not to hear.
</p>

<p>
"I can't bear to think of you working even for a day
longer in that stuffy hole!  Why, my first thought when
I heard the news was I can take her out of that!
What fun will it be for me to fluff around town
spending money when you are still jailed there, punishing
the alphabet."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" she said, trying to look
indignant.
</p>

<p>
"You know what I mean.  Or if you don't, look at
me and you'll see!"
</p>

<p>
She did not avail herself of the invitation.  "You
don't seem to have thought much of me.  What <i>I</i> might
like.  Am I nothing to you, but a sort of little follower,
a hanger-on to help you spend money!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Katy, that's unjust.  Look at me!  Katy
darling, I love you.  Will you marry me?"
</p>

<p>
"Somebody will hear you," she murmured glancing
nervously around.
</p>

<p>
"That's no answer."
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;I scarcely know you!"
</p>

<p>
"Time will fix that."
</p>

<p>
"You're not in earnest."
</p>

<p>
"I am!  Look at me!  I know you well!  For
months I have thought of you night and day.  Oh, I
tried to cut you out at first; I thought I was only
storing up trouble for myself.  Poor devil of a
stool-warmer like me.  What chance did I have?  But I
couldn't help myself!  Every time I saw your face at
the window I forgot my hard-headed resolutions.  You
see you had me at a disadvantage.  I had an ideal of
what a lady was, that I got from my mother&mdash;but
knocking round in cheap boarding houses, well you
don't meet that kind.  It was just plumb luck my
meeting you.  First time I heard your voice you just
knocked me out.  That was what I had wanted&mdash;all
my life.  Look at me!  Don't you think I'm in earnest
now?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Please</i>, not here!" she murmured.
</p>

<p>
He suddenly realized that a girl <i>is</i> entitled to a
certain degree of privacy in receiving a proposal.  "Oh!
I clean forgot where we were!" he said contritely.
"I'm sorry.  The two things are so mixed up in my
mind, I felt I couldn't tell you quick enough."
</p>

<p>
A silence fell between them.  He studied her face
wistfully, but could read nothing in the closed lips and
downcast eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Katy, dear, can't you give me one word to go on?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing definite, Katy&mdash;but just a hint I can't
stand the suspense."
</p>

<p>
She murmured softly: "My answer is no."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Katy!" he said brokenly.  "Sometimes I
thought you looked at me as if&mdash;my mistake, I
suppose.  Don't you like me, Katy?"
</p>

<p>
"One doesn't marry on liking.  I used to like you
as a poor boy; But money changes people's characters.
I'll have to wait and see."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Having left Kate at the office to which she most
unreasonably insisted on returning, Jack bethought
himself of the charge laid upon him to visit
Silas Gyde's rooms alone.  Kate's last words had not
been too discouraging, and there was a pleasant
suggestion of mystery in this new errand.  Jack's spirits
were good.
</p>

<p>
Another taxi-cab whirled him up-town to the Madagascar.
Even now, occasionally the feeling came over
him that he was living in a dream.  He fingered the
roll of bills in his pocket for reassurance.
</p>

<p>
"This is certainly me, Jack Norman," he thought.
"And this is my money!  The roll's not much smaller
either.  It must be real money because I have eaten
it, drunk it, smoked it and am wearing it!"
</p>

<p>
He entered the hotel, one of Manhattan's greatest,
with an odd little thrill in his breast.  "This is mine,"
he told himself, "all this marble and onyx and plate
glass; these tapestries, these Oriental rugs, these
tropical plants, all mine!  These good-looking bell-hops
work for me; the Duke himself yonder at the desk will
have to bend his haughty head when he finds out who
I am!"
</p>

<p>
Jack was a little shy of asking to be shown to the
late Mr. Gyde's rooms.  Having no credentials, he
suspected that his story might very well be laughed
at, and he himself be shown the door.  Anyway, he
felt an instinctive repugnance to telling his story to all
and sundry.  If he could only find out where the rooms
were he needn't apply at the desk, since he had the
keys.
</p>

<p>
An attractive young woman at the news counter
caught his attention.  He bought a magazine from her,
and while she made change sought to engage her in
conversation.
</p>

<p>
"They say Mr. Silas Gyde used to live here."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he owned this hotel."
</p>

<p>
"He must have been a queer Dick if you can believe
what you read."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the half of his queerness hasn't been printed."
</p>

<p>
"Was he a customer of yours?"
</p>

<p>
"No indeed.  He never bought anything in the
hotel.  Said he could get it cheaper outside.  Got his
meals over on Eighth avenue and around."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder he lived here at all.  Did he have a fine
suite?"
</p>

<p>
"No, the cheapest rooms in the house."
</p>

<p>
"Where were they?"
</p>

<p>
"On the second floor at the back on the Forty &mdash;&mdash;th
street side."
</p>

<p>
"He must have been a funny sight here in the lobby
with his old hand-me-downs."
</p>

<p>
"He seldom showed himself here.  He went in and
out by his private entrance on Forty &mdash;&mdash;th street."
</p>

<p>
"So he had a private entrance, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was a regular thing to see him going in
and out carrying his little oil-can."
</p>

<p>
"Oil-can!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, when he rented the hotel to the
management, he saved out his rooms rent free, but
there wasn't anything said about steam heat or electric
current, and when the management sent him a bill for
heat and light, he made them take out the radiators
and the fixtures, and he burned an oil lamp and a little
oil heater."
</p>

<p>
"Here, in the Madagascar!  Well, that beats all!"
</p>

<p>
"It sure does!"
</p>

<p>
In this little colloquy Jack had learned all that he
desired.  It was a simple matter to leave the hotel,
turn the corner into Forty &mdash;&mdash;th street and proceed to
the private entrance.  It was at the extreme end of the
hotel building, a modest door with the street numeral
painted on it.  Adjoining the hotel on this side was a
deserted dwelling with boarded up windows below, and
blinds pulled down above, the whole bearing the signs
of long neglect.
</p>

<p>
One of Jack's keys fitted the door.  Inside he found
a single flight of stairs ending on a dark landing with
another door.  This door was not locked.  Opening
it he found himself in the sitting-room of the suite,
a small room with two windows looking out on the
street he had just left.
</p>

<p>
It was a typical hotel room, furnished by contract
expensively but without taste.  An amusingly
incongruous note was furnished by the oil heater in the
center of the rug, and the cheap lamp on the table.
The naked ugliness of the latter object was not even
mitigated by a shade.  There was nothing to suggest
that the room had been a man's home for several years,
no personal belongings of any description.
</p>

<p>
Yet it was neat enough, and Jack guessed that Silas
Gyde's arrangement with the hotel must have included
maid service.  From the bedroom there was a door
to the hotel corridor, through which servants might
have entered.  This bedroom and a bathroom, both
almost entirely without light or air, completed the
suite.  Jack had no difficulty in believing that it was
one of the least desirable apartments in the hotel.
</p>

<p>
Jack's first glance around revealed nothing out of
the common.  The only signs of human occupancy
were a few cheap toilet articles on the bureau.  But
there were several closets.  That in the bedroom was
locked.  Opening it with one of his keys, Jack was
faced by his first surprise&mdash;a modern and highly
efficient steel vault door.
</p>

<p>
An alluring picture of heaped coin, greenbacks,
securities, stored inside, arose before him, but the
door was locked of course, and he had no instructions
as to the combination.  He wondered, not without
chagrin, if Silas Gyde had been a practical joker.  Why
had he been instructed to proceed there alone merely
for the pleasure of looking at a locked vault.
</p>

<p>
He went through the rooms more carefully.  In the
sitting-room there was a little fancy desk.  He had a key
to this, and upon its being opened, one of the pigeon-holes
yielded up a packet of dusty, faded papers.  He
went over them one by one; advertisements, unimportant
business letters, receipts for small amounts;
not until he reached the last envelope of all was he
rewarded.
</p>

<p>
This was sealed, and on it was written in an old
man's cramped and tremulous hand:
</p>

<p>
"For my heir."
</p>

<p>
It was like a voice from beyond the grave.
</p>

<p>
But the contents were matter-of-fact enough: no
more than this:
</p>

<p>
"<i>You are to go to James Renfrew, 120 Broadway,
who will hand you a communication from me.</i>"
</p>

<p>
This simple sentence revived the lure of mystery,
and another taxi-cab was soon bearing Jack downtown.
Since the old man's note had been written, the
famous office building at 120 Broadway had burned
down, and had risen again to five times its former
height.  The firm of Renfrew, Bates and Meldrum,
the eminent lawyers, still had their offices there, and
Jack succeeded in seeing the senior member without
too much delay.
</p>

<p>
This testy old gentleman with a snort of scorn for
what he termed "Gyde's foolishness" put Jack through
a cross-examination similar to that he had undergone
from Delamare earlier in the day.  Jack's answers
being satisfactory, he received another note in Silas
Gyde's cramped hand.
</p>

<p>
This contained a row of cabalistic figures, and
further instructions for him to go to Nathan Harris,
the well-known banker.  At this office the performance
was exactly repeated, with the exception that
Mr. Harris evinced a good deal of curiosity on his own
account.  But since it was no part of Jack's instructions
to take him into his confidence, he confined himself
to polite and non-committal answers.
</p>

<p>
The note he received here, besides giving him more
figures, sent him to the office of Sanford Gair, another
eminent lawyer.  At this stage Jack was brought to a
stand by the information that Mr. Gair had been dead
for a year.  But Jack's blood was up now: persistent
questioning finally elicited the fact that Mr. Gair's
son and executor did indeed have a note for him.
</p>

<p>
This contained another line of figures followed by
the word: "Complete."  Underneath was written:
"You are to enter alone."
</p>

<p>
"Complete?" thought Jack with knitted brows.
"What is complete?  What am I to enter alone?"
</p>

<p>
Then a light broke upon him.  "The Vault of
course!  This is the combination!"
</p>

<p>
He lost no time in returning to the Madagascar.
</p>

<p>
It may be remarked here, that when Jack afterwards
told Mr. Delamare about these visits the banker
laughed heartily.  "Isn't that like old Gyde!  Renfrew,
Nathan Harris and Gair, bitter enemies!  He wasn't
going to take any chances of their getting together!"
</p>

<p>
It was about five o'clock when Jack entered Silas
Gyde's rooms the second time.  He double-locked the
door leading to the hotel corridor, and set to work
on the combination with a burglarious feeling, which all
his assurances to himself that it was his own property
could not quite dissipate.
</p>

<p>
Jack had had no experience with such elaborate
locks as this, but after all the principle was the same
as that of Fisher's safe where he had been accustomed
to keeping his books at night.  After a number of
false starts and misses, the steel bolts finally rang
back, and the great door swung noiselessly outward.
</p>

<p>
Alas for Jack's expectations!  The vault inside was
as bare as Mother Hubbard's cupboard.  There was not
so much as a scrap of paper to be seen, let alone the
dazzling stores he had pictured.  The wall down each
side were lined with shelves on which lay a thick,
undisturbed coating of dust.  Apparently there never had
been anything kept there; at least not for a long time.
</p>

<p>
Jack was thoroughly disgusted.  All that chasing
around town for nothing!  Was his benefactor's only
purpose in taking those elaborate precautions to make
a fool of his heir?  Perhaps the old man had been
really insane.
</p>

<p>
But having taken all that trouble Jack did not mean
to give up until he had made very sure there was
nothing to be gained from it.  He examined the vault
anew, and presently made a curious discovery in the
steel door.  Differing from any safe he had ever seen,
the handle which operated the bolt ran right through
to the inside of the door, also the dial and knob of the
combination were reproduced inside.
</p>

<p>
"What did he want that for?" thought Jack, with
perplexed brow.  "Almost looks as if he wanted to
lock himself up inside."
</p>

<p>
It was dark within the vault, and Jack lit the oil
lamp and carried it in.  He had not paid much attention
to the back of the vault, for his eye had told him it was
flush with the outer wall of the building, but he was
now struck by the fact that whereas the sides of the
vault were of concrete the back wall was of steel, and
there were no shelves covering it.
</p>

<p>
In short, the lamp revealed the outline of a door
in the back wall, a steel door so beautifully fitted that
only the tiniest of lines marked its boundaries.  In it
was a tiny slit that Jack's fourth and last key exactly
fitted.  When it was pressed home, the door swung
towards him on a spring.
</p>

<p>
Here he received another surprise.  Instead of the
shallow wall cupboard he expected, for he knew he
was against the outer wall of the hotel, the beams of
the lamp illuminated a large cupboard heaped with
rubbish in the corners.  At the same moment he was
greatly startled to hear an electric bell start ringing
somewhere further within.
</p>

<p>
He realized of course that he had stumbled on a
secret way into the house adjoining the hotel.  He
remembered the aspect of that house from the street,
shuttered, neglected, dirty.  What would the inside
reveal?  The feeble, fretful alarm of the electric bell
perturbed him.  He closed the steel door and it
stopped: he let it swing open and the sound
recommenced.  For whom was it a warning?  Inside the
closet on his right there was an ordinary wooden door.
It did not help to compose his nerves to hear a soft
urgent whining and scratching on the other side of it.
The lamp trembled a little in his hand.
</p>

<p>
However there was nothing for it but to advance.
Jack was boy enough to refuse to take a dare.  He
had been instructed to enter alone, and he was not
sufficiently frightened to disobey.  There was a kind of
fascination in entering upon this voyage of discovery
alone.  Moreover he had no reason to suppose that
a trap had been prepared for him.
</p>

<p>
Before venturing in, he took a careful survey of the
closet.  The litter in the corners consisted of old
clothes, old boots, newspapers.  A musty smell arose
from it.  His attention was caught by a broad black
belt painted on the floor at his feet.  Stooping, he
touched it, and the black came off on his finger.
</p>

<p>
"Soot," he thought.  He took care to step over it
when he entered.
</p>

<p>
The scratching still continued on the other side of
the inner door, but Jack was reassured by the sound
of an anxious little bark.  "That's not a very
formidable animal," he thought, smiling, and opening the
door.
</p>

<p>
His first impression was of a little black and tan
terrier, who waited just inside the door with an
expression of anxiety, human in its intensity.  At the
sight of Jack the dog snarled and attempted to retreat,
but weakness overcame it and it fell.
</p>

<p>
"Poor beastie!" murmured Jack.
</p>

<p>
The little animal, whether reassured by Jack's voice
or prompted by his own great need, attempted to make
friends.  He approached wagging a feeble tail.  He
dragged himself towards the fireplace, and with piteous,
speaking glances, directed Jack's attention to a
tin box upon the mantel.  A human voice could scarcely
have been plainer.
</p>

<p>
"Is that where they keep it, old man?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
In the box were some crusts.  He made haste to toss
them to the little dog, and filled his dish with water.
</p>

<p>
Jack found himself in a good-sized room to which
no ray of daylight penetrated.  His sense of direction
told him it must be the second floor rear of the dwelling
house.  There was no lack of character here.  The
place was both sordid and piteous, and very eloquent
of Silas Gyde's strange life.
</p>

<p>
"This was his real home," thought Jack, looking
around.  "The hotel apartment was simply a blind....
Poor old fellow!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
5
</h3>

<p>
Jack as an instinctive precaution returned to close
the vault door, and the inner steel door.  The
latter was provided with a handle on the closet side to
draw it to.  When Jack closed it the irritating little
bell stopped ringing.
</p>

<p>
"That was to warn him if any one opened it while
he was inside," thought Jack.  "And the band of
soot on the floor was to inform him if his stronghold
had been entered during his absence.  What a queer
old boy to take so much trouble to hide himself!"
</p>

<p>
Silas Gyde's room in its architectural features was
exactly like thousands of second floor backs in the
endless rows of houses built from forty to fifty years ago.
As Jack stood inside the closet door by which he had
entered, two windows faced him, looking out on the
back yards he knew, though they were closely curtained.
At his right was a fireplace with a composition mantel,
at his left was the door leading to the stair hall.  The
bed was below the hall door: it is always there.  And
adjoining the room on that side would be the bath room.
Jack had lived in many such houses.
</p>

<p>
The air in the room was heavy, but less foul than
might have been expected.  Jack found behind the
curtains that ventilators had been ingeniously
contrived, which could be opened and shut without one's
showing oneself at the window.  For that matter the
glass of the windows was well-nigh opaque with the
accumulation of years of dust.  The bed was tumbled
but clean.  Jack suspected that the old man had changed
linen with the bed in the hotel.  There was a similar
oil lamp and oil heater in here.
</p>

<p>
"Those outside were a plant while these got the oil
he carried in," thought Jack.
</p>

<p>
The room was hideously cheerless.  Rubbish was
piled everywhere.  There was an old flat-topped desk
with its back to the windows, and a sort of path had
been cleared from the desk to the closet door with a
branch to the bed midway.  Elsewhere the litter had
swamped everything.  It was principally newspapers.
Jack had never seen so many old newspapers in his life.
One corner of the room was filled by a small mountain
of scrap books containing faded clippings.  When Jack
came to examine them he found that all the items
related to Silas Gyde, and most of them were abusive.
</p>

<p>
Yet from the walls of this unlovely room looked
down a few rarely beautiful old pictures, and, as Jack
was to learn later, they were of almost priceless value.
Evidently at some period of his career the old miser
had had generous stirrings.  One of these pictures
caused Jack a great start.  It occupied the space next
to the closet door, hence he did not see it until he had
come into the room and had turned around.
</p>

<p>
It was his mother.  An enlargement by a talented
hand of the wistful girlhood picture Delamare had
given him that morning.  She looked down on the fusty
disarray with pitying eyes: she was startlingly young
and alive in that dark place.  The tears welled up in
Jack's eyes again.
</p>

<p>
"Think of her presiding over a den like this!  I'll
give her a sunnier prospect.  But he must have loved
her well!  I'll credit him with that."
</p>

<p>
A tour of the rest of the house from cellar to
garret revealed only emptiness, darkness and a smell of
must.
</p>

<p>
Returning to Silas Gyde's room, Jack went to his
desk.  This spot alone of all the room was in good
order.  On it lay a book open and face down at the
page where the dead man had left off reading.  It
was the <i>Ordeal of Richard Feveril</i>, and it was open
at the page describing the first meeting of Richard and
Lucy.  Jack read a few lines and wondered that Silas
Gyde could have cared for that sort of thing.  It didn't
seem to go with the rest of him.  Jack slipped the
book in his pocket, against an opportunity to make its
better acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
There was also a fat red leather note book, a sort
of journal, in which Silas Gyde had entered the details
of his financial transactions.  Jack saved that for his
lawyer.  Finally there was a manuscript which Death
had interrupted in the middle of a sheet.  Turning back
to the first page Jack was not a little astonished to find
that it was a sort of letter addressed to himself.  From
the dates upon it, it had been started five years before
and added to from time to time.
</p>

<p>
Jack sat down to read it.  The little dog, making it
clear that he had adopted a new master, lay at his
feet.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"To John Farrow Norman:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Dear Jack:
</p>

<p>
"Everybody knows old Silas Gyde&mdash;or thinks he
does.  Miser, usurer, skinflint, champion tightwad&mdash;I
quote from the collection of clippings I have made.
What everybody says must be true, I suppose, but it is
not the whole truth.  There is another Silas Gyde&mdash;or
there was once, and it is he who writes to you.
</p>

<p>
"Little did you guess that I have been keeping track
of you since you were quite a small boy.  I have always
from that time intended to make you my heir.  I
suppose you wonder why I never made myself known to
you.  There were several reasons.  For one thing I
have noticed that the relations between a rich man and
his heir are seldom happy.  I didn't care to read in
your eyes that you wished the old fool would hurry up
and die and be done with it.
</p>

<p>
"Another thing, and this is the real reason: as the
years pass it becomes more and more difficult for me
to make overtures to anybody.  It sounds silly for an
old fellow of near sixty to confess that he is shy, but
such is the fact.  And shyness in the old is a torturing
thing.  They call me queer, cranky, crazy, and the
truth is simply that I am shy.  I never could run with
the herd.
</p>

<p>
"It is true what they say, that I have not a friend
in the world, and now I would not know how to set
about making one.  Especially a young one.  I am
afraid of you, my boy; afraid of your terrible, pitiless
youthfulness.  And so I just imagine you are my friend.
I have long talks with you, and give you quantities of
good advice, to which you give dutiful heed.
</p>

<p>
"At the same time I have always kept a sort of watch
over you.  And if actual misfortune had overtaken you
I would have found a way to come to your assistance.
A little poverty and hard work will enable you to
appreciate riches later.
</p>

<p>
"By this time you have learned that I was once your
mother's suitor.  She refused me for the first Jack
Norman, your father.  I wonder if your mother ever
talked to you about me.  Probably not.  She was never
a talker.  Well, I hope you will never have such a
blow as that was to me.  I don't think you will.  You
have a certain grace (I have seen you), Phoebe's grace,
that will endear you to your chosen maiden.  As for
me, even as a youth I was a dry stick.
</p>

<p>
"What made it harder for me was that I despised
your father as a weaker man than myself.  When I
let this out to your mother in my anger and bitterness,
she retorted that if he was less strong he was certainly
more lovable.
</p>

<p>
"I left Cartonsville in my bitterness.  My one idea,
like so many galled young men before me, was to do
something that would force Phoebe Farrow to acknowledge
to herself that she had chosen the wrong man.  I
resolved to make myself a rich man, the richest in
America.  To gain this end I was prepared to deny
myself everything above the barest necessities of life.
Every cent was to be set to work to earn five.
</p>

<p>
"I succeeded, as every man must, who is bent on a
thing so determinedly as I was.  I did not return to
Cartonsville for fifteen years.  Fifteen years of slavery
they were.  Those were the years that formed me for
life&mdash;deformed me I should say.  I was already a rich
man when I went back.
</p>

<p>
"I found the situation much as I had imagined it.
Your mother was the hard-working wife of a poor man&mdash;a
man destined to die poor.  She lived in a small
inconvenient house without any servant, and her pretty
hands were red and rough.  And I was a millionaire.
You were five years old at that time and your parents'
only child.  Both your elder brothers had died in an
epidemic.
</p>

<p>
"But my triumph did not come off as I had pictured.
Phoebe pitied me.
</p>

<p>
"'No wife nor chick?' she said, with her rare soft
smile.  'Poor Silas!  How useless your wealth must
seem to you!'
</p>

<p>
"Then I saw as in a great white light that I had
only been a fool for my pains.  I returned to New
York and automatically resumed the business of
making money.  I could not stop.  It was all I knew.  It
filled my days and kept me from thinking.
</p>

<p>
"I often wished to change my way of life, but it
was too late then.  I was already known as Silas Gyde
the usurer, and men had hardened their hearts against
me.  My diffident attempts to make friends were
rebuffed.  I was forced back into the rut I had worn for
myself.  There was nothing for me to do but earn
the reputation the world had given me.
</p>

<p>
"I have told you that in fancy I often gave you
advice.  But it is not as a good example that I desire to
hold myself up to you.  I urge you to avoid my
example.  Never let money get the upper hand of you.
Old Silas Gyde the miser tells you money is no good
except to spend.  I have succeeded in creating the
incubus of wealth, and in so doing lost my soul.  I
leave you the harder task of ridding yourself of it,
without losing yours.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Your well-wisher,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silas Gyde."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Under a date two years later the letter was resumed:
</p>

<p>
"I have opened this to add a warning.  When you
inherit my money, you are bound to inherit my cares
also.  Ever since I became rich enough to be notorious,
I have been a target for men's envy and hate.  I
expected it.  Indeed, I enjoyed it in a way.  I gloated
over my books of clippings.  Their hatred gave me a
sense of being somebody in the world.
</p>

<p>
"In my daily mail I received, and still receive, hundreds
of letters, appealing, threatening, abusive; letters
from every kind of crank.  I ignore them.  But lately
a real danger has begun to threaten me in the spread of
anarchistic doctrines among the people.  And there
are not lacking those to turn the justifiable discontent
of the people to their own blackguardly advantage.
My threatening missives now have an organized hatred
behind them.
</p>

<p>
"The culmination was reached a month ago in the
shocking death of Ames Benton, the first tragedy of
the kind that has occurred in America&mdash;but not the
last I fear.  I knew the man; I did business with him;
I had talked to him the day before his death.  What
brought it closer home to me was the fact that Benton
was what you'd call a popular man; openhanded,
affable, of a kindly nature.  If they did this to him, what
will my fate be!
</p>

<p>
"The affair may be forgotten by the time you read
this, so I will say Benton was a prominent and wealthy
man&mdash;though not so rich as I&mdash;president and director
in many corporations.  He was blown to pieces in his bed
at night by an anarchist's bomb.  The man that threw
it likewise lost his life in the explosion.  How he
succeeded in reaching Mr. Benton's bedroom will always
remain a mystery.  Among Mr. Benton's effects were
found threatening letters similar to those I have
received.  The assassin's accomplices&mdash;it is believed that
he must have had accomplices&mdash;have never been
found.
</p>

<p>
"This affair has not helped me to sleep better of
nights.  My courage is of the daylight variety.  So
long as I can have my eyes open and my wits about me,
I am willing to take my chances, but at the thought of
being attacked in my bed I confess my heart turns to
water.  So I have taken my measures.
</p>

<p>
"The Madagascar Hotel which I was building was
all but complete.  To secure light and air on the
West I had already bought the adjoining dwelling on
Forty &mdash;&mdash;th street.  I got it cheap because it had
been a private insane asylum and was in bad odor in
the neighborhood.  The transaction had been effected
through agents, and it was not known that I was the
owner.
</p>

<p>
"I had an opening cut between the hotel and this
dwelling.  By distributing the work among many hands
I was able to conceal my eventual purpose from all.
The people who put in the steel doors thought that the
rear door was to give on a shallow cupboard in the
wall.  When the doors were in I knocked out this
cupboard myself and had a clear way through.  Nobody
who knew thought it at all out of the way that
Silas Gyde should put in a steel vault in connection
with his suite in the hotel.
</p>

<p>
"I have installed myself in a rear room of the old
dwelling.  The front of the house which has been
boarded up for years I was careful not to disturb.
Here I can sleep in peace.  If the ghosts of the poor
insane patients stalk through the halls, they do not
trouble me.
</p>

<p>
"But they may get me yet, of course, and I am
writing to put you in possession of all the particulars.  I
am sure now, that there is a devilishly able brain using
the anarchistic agitation to further a blackmailing
scheme on a gigantic scale.
</p>

<p>
"For instance, immediately after poor Benton's
death I received a letter threatening me with the same
fate, and I have reason to believe that many other rich
men received similar letters.  I promptly put mine in
the hands of the police, as did others, with what result?
None, except that I instantly received another letter
apprising me that my act was known, and that if I did
not immediately cease all dealings with the police I
would be shot down in the street.
</p>

<p>
"I ignored this letter, and three days later I got a
bullet through my hat in City Hall Square.  The
newspapers seemed to take the attitude that it was no more
than my due.  But the other rich men appreciated the
significance of the act, and I have no doubt the
blackmailing business was much stimulated thereby.  Still
the police did nothing, and I resolved to have no more
to do with those gentry, but to protect myself.
</p>

<p>
"Now observe.  A week after the attack on me I was
called upon in my office by a polite young man who
handed me the card of the 'Eureka Protective
Association.'  His proposition in brief was, that for a stated
sum paid every month (four hundred dollars was the
amount named) his organization would guarantee to
protect me against all threats from Anarchists, and
would warn me in advance of any plans that were laid
to attempt my life.  Since the police had failed to
suppress the Reds, he said, his people had succeeded in
placing their agents in every circle of anarchists, to take
note of and report on all their activities.
</p>

<p>
"Ingenious, was it not?  I could well imagine that
many of my timorous wealthy acquaintances would fall
for it eagerly after all the agitations of the past few
weeks.  But to me it smelled rank of blackmail.  It
seemed to me that if I once submitted, the impost would
promptly be doubled, trebled, quadrupled, and instead
of securing peace I would be letting myself in for a life
of continuous alarms.  I might as well die at once.
Anyhow, I thought, it wasn't possible that every rich man
would submit, and they couldn't very well assassinate us
all.  My chance was as good as another's.
</p>

<p>
"So I turned the polite young man down, and took
my own measures.  I closed my office down-town, and
carried my business under my hat, as they say.  I traded
impartially through every broker in town.  I have
moved into my retreat in the old house, and venture out
only by daylight, keeping to the crowded streets.  The
secret of my sleeping-place is still a secret I am sure.
I have had no more threatening letters, and I hope they
have crossed me off their lists as a hopeless prospect.
But if they do get me, you will know all the circumstances."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The next entry had been made nine months later.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"My dear boy:
</p>

<p>
"The long evenings are hard to get through.  My
eyes tire with reading, and my thoughts are not cheering.
I have tried playing solitaire, but it seems like
the last resource of the feeble-minded.  I have got me
a little dog for company, picked him up half-starved,
but he's a great sleepyhead.
</p>

<p>
"I think of you more and more.  I wish I dared go
to you and make myself known.  But I have put it off
too long.  I know now that I shall never go.  This is
the only medium I can use to communicate with you.
You will know me after I am gone.  Who knows,
perhaps I shall have left a friend here after all."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Several pages of good advice followed here; cynical,
humorous, friendly, out of the old millionaire's store of
experience.  A very different Silas Gyde was revealed
from him the world knew.  But for the moment Jack
skimmed over this part hastily in his anxiety to learn
more of the facts bearing on his benefactor's end.
</p>

<p>
The last entry was only three days old.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
"Three years have now elapsed since I told you of
the first threats against my life.  The threats have been
renewed from time to time.  That I am still above
ground is due to no lack of effort on the part of my
enemy, I am sure.  More and more I feel that one man
is behind it all.  One attempt has been made on my life
that I know of, and no doubt others.  My supposed
room in the Madagascar has been entered.  But my
real abiding-place is still my secret, I believe.
</p>

<p>
"Now I want to tell you of a new direction their
activities have taken.
</p>

<p>
"About three weeks ago in the flock of begging
letters that assail me every day there was one which
caught my attention.  It purported to be from a young
girl struggling to make her way in New York as a visiting
stenographer, and asked me if I could give her occasional
work.  An affecting note of simplicity seemed to
distinguish it from the usual type of such letters.  'Why
shouldn't even Silas Gyde do a good act?' I asked
myself, and sent for her to come to the public writing room
of the hotel.
</p>

<p>
"Previous to that I had been dictating to public
stenographers wherever I happened to drop in.  They
didn't know me of course, and thus my business secrets
were safeguarded.  So you see it was at somewhat of a
sacrifice that I engaged my pretty petitioner.
</p>

<p>
"She was extremely pretty, and seemingly well-bred.
Her modest manner carried out the promise of her letter.
Perhaps I am not sufficiently experienced with the
sex.  No man ever fooled me for long.  For two weeks
she came every day that I needed her.  She was not a
very expert stenographer but filled my simple demands.
I noticed on her part a willingness to enter into more
personal relations with her employer, but I didn't blame
her for that, poor girl.  A hundred millions I supposed
was enough to sugar even such an old pill as Silas Gyde.
</p>

<p>
"But a week ago in amongst the bundle of completed
letters she left with me, had been slipped by chance
the page of a letter she had been writing on her own
account.  The beginning was missing, but the piece I
had was sufficiently significant.  I will paste it below."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The inserted typewritten page read as follows:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>&mdash;where the old man sleeps.  You say you are sure
he doesn't occupy his bed in the Madagascar, but I
haven't been able to find out anything to the contrary.
Apparently he comes down from his room to give me
dictation.  He never has me up there, though I have
complained about the noise down-stairs, etc.  I got in
touch with the chambermaid that does up his room,
as you suggested.  She doesn't suspect that the bed is
not slept in every night.  I understood that she has
to make it up in the mornings, like all the other beds.
So I think you are mistaken in saying that suite is a
blind.  Give me a little more time and I will make sure
through one of the clerks (with whom I am friendly)
if S.G. has another suite somewhere in the hotel.</i>

Silas Gyde's ms. resumed:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"When my young lady came the following day I
observed a certain anxiety in her glance.  Evidently she
was not sure where she had lost that tell-tale paper.
She sounded me discreetly.  I was careful to show her
an unchanged front, and she finally made up her mind
that I had not seen it.  I continued to give her work
just as before, and after several days quietly dropped
her.  That was yesterday.
</p>

<p>
"This incident has made me thoughtful of course,
showing how close they had come to my secret.  They
may get me at any time.  If they do, they will most
assuredly transfer their attentions to you as soon as it
is published that you are my heir.  Therefore I wish
you to be armed with all the information possible.
</p>

<p>
"The name this precious young lady gave me was
Beatrice Blackstone.  That means nothing of course.
But her good looks were really notable, even to my
dim old eyes, and I will try to give you a description
that will put you on your guard, should she ever bring
her fascinations to bear on you.
</p>

<p>
"She said she was twenty-three, but seemed in
unguarded moments to be a good five or six years older.
She was a brunette with lustrous, wavy chestnut hair
and hazel eyes of extraordinary size and brilliancy.
By hazel I mean gray eyes with a rim of brown around
the iris.  With me she played a demure part, but there
were moments when I saw that she could do the
haughty and imperious too.  She was tall for a woman,
about five feet seven I should say, and of a very elegant
figure which seemed slimmer than it was.  Weight about
a hundred and thirty-five.  She walked with a peculiar
undulating motion, bobbing her head slightly with each
step.  When she was taking dictation I noticed on the
index finger of her right hand a large pale mole, round
in shape and of the bigness of a button on a woman's
glove.  So much for Beatrice Blackstone.
</p>

<p>
"I find that the pleasure of writing to you is growing
on me and I mean to make a regular thing of it
hereafter."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Those were the last words.

<p>
Jack sat staring at the letter he had just read,
deeply stirred by feelings new to him.  Youth
generally is profoundly unaware of the hearts of the aged.
The feeling is that the old have had their day, have
cooled off and hardened, and practically ceased to exist.
It came with a shock of surprise to Jack to learn that an
old man might be misunderstood, bitter, hungry for
affection&mdash;just the same as a young one.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old fellow!" he murmured.  "He thought of
me a lot!  He was good to me.  And I never knew.  If
I had known him I might have made his last days easier.
I might have prevented what happened."
</p>

<p>
Hard on these softer feelings rose a slow tide of
anger.  "Oh, the devils!  To think up such a fiend's
game!  And then to get away with it!  It's too much
for an honest man to stand!  I wish I could pay them
off! ... I <i>will</i> pay them off.  I have power now.
That shall be my job.  If I live I'll square this account!"
</p>

<p>
He registered his vow with an involuntary glance
upward at his mother's portrait.  It seemed to him
that the wistful face softened on him in approval.
</p>

<p>
The impulse to action brought Jack to his feet.
Peeping through the curtains he saw that darkness had
fallen outside.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" he thought astonished.  "How long
have I been here!"
</p>

<p>
His watch informed him that it was eight o'clock.
He picked up the lamp, and with a last look around
the strange room turned to leave.  He had a feeling
that that place marked a turning point in his life.  He
would never again be quite the light-hearted boy that
had entered it.
</p>

<p>
He had forgotten the dog.  The little beast seeing
his purpose, and terrified of being left alone again,
threw himself against Jack's legs in a desperate appeal
to be taken along.
</p>

<p>
Jack stooped to caress him.  "Poor old fellow!" he
said.  "I wonder how long it is since you saw the light
of the sun.  I can't take you now, honest I can't.  But
you be patient.  I'll be back to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
But the tiny animal thrust himself into Jack's
embrace and would not be denied.  Jack finally picked
him up and thrust him in his coat pocket.  He settled
down quite contentedly, only his nozzle and his bright
eyes showing.
</p>

<p>
"Well I guess you must be accustomed to this mode
of travel," said Jack.  "I'm going to call you Jumbo
because that's not your name."
</p>

<p>
Carefully locking all the doors behind him, he left
the lamp in the hotel sitting-room, and made his way
out by the private entrance.  His impulse was to seek
his own hall bedroom, the nearest thing to home that
he knew, and there alone, amidst familiar surroundings,
to try to bring some order out of his whirling
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Jack's boarding house was in the West Forties near
Eighth avenue, in the center of that vast colony of
boarders.  His way from the Madagascar lay up
Broadway for three short blocks, then westward for a
long one.  He passed through the throng hurrying
theaterward without seeing anybody; he forgot that
he had had no dinner; he forgot that his pocket was
full of money and was tempted by none of the alluring
show-windows.
</p>

<p>
The burden of his thoughts was: "It's a big job!
A big job!  I can't afford to make any mistake at the
start!"
</p>

<p>
In front of a corner newsstand he was brought up
all standing by a glimpse of the staring headlines of the
night editions.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
  HEIR TO THE GYDE MILLIONS<br />
  FOUND IN A HALL BEDROOM<br />
</p>

<p class="t3">
  A POOR BOY IS ENRICHED BEYOND THE DREAMS OF<br />
  AVARICE<br />
</p>

<p class="t3">
  <i>Old Romance in the Dead Millionaire's Life Revealed</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Jack bought several papers, and standing in a doorway
out of the press of the crowd, experienced the first
wonderful thrill of finding himself famous.  There is
nothing else quite like it.  How you became famous is
a secondary matter.  To find yourself on the first page
is enough: to see the shape of your name in print.
Many a good head has been turned for life by it.
</p>

<p>
All the papers offered sensational versions of Jack's
story, more or less accurate.  It had apparently been
given out at Delamare's office in the first place, and so
far they had it pretty straight.  But they went on to
embroider it.  The more reckless sheets even printed
interviews which caused Jack to grind his teeth, they
made him out such a fool.  One paper printed an
alleged photograph, but it was a safely fuzzy
photograph that might have been taken for almost anybody.
They had discovered the address of his boarding-house,
but in his absence his landlady, Mrs. Regan, had
refused to be drawn out.
</p>

<p>
"Good old girl!" thought Jack.
</p>

<p>
The soberer sheets promised an interview in later
editions.
</p>

<p>
"They're looking for me now!" thought Jack.
</p>

<p>
Being human, Jack could not but feel a pleasurable
thrill, but his head was not quite turned.  He glanced
at the hurrying passers-by whimsically.
</p>

<p>
"They wouldn't rush by so fast if they knew this
was he," he thought.  But he had no intention of calling
their attention to the fact.  Silas Gyde's reference
to the danger of too much publicity was present in his
mind.
</p>

<p>
He turned into his own street keeping a wary eye
ahead.  Mrs. Regan's boarding house was three-quarters
of the way down the block, one of a long row
of dwellings with little grass plots in front and iron
railings.  Sure enough by the light of a street lamp Jack
made out the figures of a group of men at her gate.
As he came closer he saw that several of them carried
cameras with flash light attachments.
</p>

<p>
His first impulse was to flee, but recollecting that
they could not possibly know yet what he looked like,
he walked boldly up to the group, and asked the New
Yorker's stock question of a street crowd:
</p>

<p>
"Somepin the matter here?"
</p>

<p>
One replied: "This where Jack Norman lives.
We're waitin' for him to come home."
</p>

<p>
He was already so famous no further explanation
was deemed necessary.
</p>

<p>
"Gee!" said Jack with a glance at the shabby façade.
"I guess he'll soon be moving."
</p>

<p>
A laugh greeted this witty sally.
</p>

<p>
"Oh boy!" groaned one youth.  "Think of having
a hundred millions handed you, just like that.  It's too
much!"
</p>

<p>
A photographer said: "Well, I'm gonna ast him for
one million.  He'd never miss it."
</p>

<p>
"What like fellow is he?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Same aged guy as us."
</p>

<p>
"Worked for twelve per until this morning.  Say
his old boss was sore as a pup when he heard what he
come in for."
</p>

<p>
"They say he's a bad actor all right."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, a whale!  They say he's already burned up
Broadway from Herald Square to the Circle."
</p>

<p>
"You're wrong, fellow!  I heard his roll's as
adhesive as rubber tape.  Same as the old man's before
him.  Wouldn't even pry off a nickel to give the poor
boy who told him the news."
</p>

<p>
"Say, when a guy once gets in the papers, scandal
begins!" said Jack disgustedly.  Seeing Mrs. Regan at
her parlor window, and fearful that she might give him
away, he walked on.
</p>

<p>
From a drug-store on Eighth avenue he telephoned
back to Mrs. Regan, asking her to come to him there.
"Don't let anything on to those guys at the gate," he
warned her.  "I want to keep out of sight for a few
days."
</p>

<p>
She came into the store in a breathless state of
fluster.  She was a good-hearted Irishwoman of considerable
energy of character and a racy style of speech.
But at present she was considerably overcome.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Norman!  Oh, Mr. Norman!" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Easy with my name!" warned Jack.  "I'm going to
be Mr. Robinson for awhile now."
</p>

<p>
"Is it true what they say in the papers?"
</p>

<p>
"More or less."
</p>

<p>
"Oh law!  To think of anything like this happening
in my house!  And the third floor rear hall at that!
But that's always the way ain't it, like a story like?
The telephone's been going like a Big Ben ever since
twelve o'clock, asking for you.  And you such a pleasant
ordinary young fellow&mdash;not to say ordinary-like, but not
stuck up at all, just like one of us!"  She paused for
breath.
</p>

<p>
"Easy, Mrs. Regan," whispered Jack.  "That clerk's
got ears like a water pitcher."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be careful.  What did you want of me,
Mr. Nor&mdash;Robinson?"
</p>

<p>
"First, I want you to know my friend Jumbo," said
Jack, handing him over.  "Let him have my eats while
I'm away."
</p>

<p>
"Laws!  Ain't he cute!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll telephone in every little while for news.  Please
pack up my things for me.  I'll tell you later where to
send them."
</p>

<p>
"You're going to leave!" cried Mrs. Regan.  "But
of course it's natural," she added quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you make any mistake," said Jack.  "I'm not
going to forget any of the friends who knew me when
I was poor."
</p>

<p>
"I done my best for you!  But with prices the way
they is&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"I know.  Now I want you to promise not to give
out a thing about me, no descriptions of me, no information
of any kind.  I know it will be hard to resist those
taking young reporters, but I ask it as a favor."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. N&mdash;Robinson!  Go on!  At my age!&mdash;  It's
little they'll get out of me, I can tell you!"
</p>

<p>
"I knew I could bank on you.  I'll tell you all about
it some day.  I've got to beat it now."
</p>

<p>
"Good-by.  Oh&mdash;wait!  I almost forgot.  I'm that
excited!  A messenger boy left a note for you at the
door this evening.  I brought it along."
</p>

<p>
Jack took the note and left.  Mrs. Regan, a little
disappointed at not being taken further into his
confidence, turned in the other direction.  When she was
out of sight, Jack stopped under a street lamp and
examined what she had given him.
</p>

<p>
It was a cheap, flimsy envelope much soiled.  The
address was scrawled in an illiterate hand.  He opened
it, and this was what he read:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Jack Norman</i>:
</p>

<p>
"<i>We don't call you dear sir, because this ain't no
friendly letter.  We know all about you.  We're the
gang what croaked old Silas Gyde, and we're going to
get you next, see?  You needn't think you're going to
be let to blow in his tainted money.  You millionaires
are a dirty disgrace, and we're going to rid the country
of you.  You can't hide away from us.  We are everywhere.
Gun, knife, bomb or dope: it's all the same to
us.  And if you show this to the police you'll only get
yours quicker.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>The Red Gang.</i>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Jack's young face turned grim.  "So it's begun!"
he thought.  "Well, I'm just as glad they didn't keep
me in suspense.  I'm ready to start.  We'll see who's
got the best set of wits!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Jack, forbidden the refuge of his own little room,
continued to walk the streets, while he debated
how best to meet the complicated situation that faced
him.  Stumbling at last on Bryant Park in his
wanderings, he dropped on a bench.  His eyes moved
sightlessly over the scene before him.
</p>

<p>
"Once the newspaper guys get hold of me, and print
my picture on the front page, I'm a marked man," he
was thinking, "I couldn't walk down the street then,
without a crowd following.  It would be a cinch for this
gang to keep tab on me, and a fat chance I'd have of
getting anything on them.  So I've got to keep out of
the papers if I can.  That's decided.
</p>

<p>
"But it's not going to be so easy.  For the more of
a mystery I make of myself the hotter they'll get on my
trail.  A paper like the <i>Sphere</i>, I suppose, would spend
a hundred thousand to run me down.  What I ought to
do is to get some harmless young fellow to take the
part of Jack Norman, while I lie low and do my work."
</p>

<p>
"Who could I get in our gang?  There's Bill Endicott;
good fellow, but too much of a talker, specially
with a girl.  He'd never do.  There's Joe Welland,
he's close enough&mdash;but too thick.  He couldn't take a
part any more than a bronze statue.  They say Stan
Larkin and I look alike.  He might do.  No!  He's
too hard-headed.  He wouldn't do what I wanted.
It's too risky anyhow to let one of the gang in on this.
The others would have to know.  I'd better keep away
from them for the present."
</p>

<p>
Jack's reflections were interrupted by an appeal from
alongside: "Say, fella, can you help a fella to a meal?"
</p>

<p>
He became aware for the first that he shared the
bench with another.  It was a fat youth of about his
own age with an expression at once piteous and absurd.
There is bound to be something ludicrous in the
spectacle of a fat beggar.  Chubby cheeks were designed to
wear a good-natured smile.  The shame-faced look that
accompanied the appeal did not suggest the professional
beggar in this case.
</p>

<p>
Jack had reached the point where he was glad of a
diversion.  His thoughts had begun to chase themselves
in circles.  "What's the trouble, 'Bo?" he asked
in friendly fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Down on my luck, that's all.  I'm an actor.  Got
a job to walk on in a big show called 'Ulysses.'  Rehearsed
three weeks and then they flivved.  I had borrowed
every cent I could on the job, and now I dassent
be seen where my friends are.  I'm done!  Ain't eaten
since yesterday.  Say, it's Hell for a fat man to be
hungry!"
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed.  Moreover the word "hunger"
started something insistent in his own internals.  He
dropped a further consideration of his problems until
that should be satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"By Gad!  That reminds me I haven't had any
dinner myself!  Come on, let's see what we can find."
</p>

<p>
"You mean it!"
</p>

<p>
"Where'll we go."
</p>

<p>
"There's Little's over here on Sixth."
</p>

<p>
"To Hell with Little's!  I'm fed up on beaneries.  It
would take a hundred of Little's little portions to fill
me.  No, I got money 'Bo!  Us for the big eats.  Let's
try that swell French café on the south side of the
square.  The French know how to eat."
</p>

<p>
"Ahh!  They wouldn't serve a guy like me in there!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, the clothing stores over on Broadway are
open yet.  Let's go and get you an outfit.  An actor's
got to show his Tuppenheimers they say, before he can
pull down a salary."
</p>

<p>
"Ahh!  You're stringin' me!"
</p>

<p>
"Come along!  I got a wad that's burning a hole in
my jeans!  I might as well blow it on you!"
</p>

<p>
The fat youth made up his mind that Jack had been
drinking.  He had an open countenance, and upon it
was clearly visible his thankfulness to Heaven for
sending such a one his way.  As Jack started off he took his
arm, either with the idea of guiding his footsteps, or in
fear that he might escape.  His anxious glance,
prepared for any sudden, unfavorable change in the
weather, never left Jack's face.  He even pretended for
the sake of camaraderie to be a little spiffed himself.
</p>

<p>
Jack was vastly tickled by the whole incident.  It
gave him a new luxurious sensation of opulence.
Besides, he had reached the point where he felt he had to
blow off a little steam.
</p>

<p>
"What a fool I was to worry myself to a standstill!
Too much thinking is worse than none at all.  If you
mull over a thing too long, your thoughts begin to go
round like a squirrel in a revolving cage.  Here's the
whole town open to us!  We'll have us a time and
forget our troubles!"
</p>

<p>
The fat youth who had no idea of the nature of
these troubles made haste to agree.  "You're dead
right, fellow!  Eat, drink and be merry, as the poet
says, for to-morrow the rent falls due!"
</p>

<p>
"What's your name?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Private or professional?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, anything you like."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm generally known as Guy Harmsworth."
</p>

<p>
"Some name, 'Bo!"
</p>

<p>
However, the really significant names seem to come
out of the air.  Jack started calling his friend 'Bo.
From that it was but a little step to Bobo.  In the sound
of Bobo there was something subtly descriptive.  It
stuck.  He is Bobo still.
</p>

<p>
As they entered the big clothing store Jack said:
"Get the best.  I'll stand for it."
</p>

<p>
Bobo thus encouraged, proved to have a very nice
taste in wearing apparel.  They bought hurriedly, for
the pangs of hunger were pressing.  But when the main
articles, suit, hat, shoes, were out of the way both young
men plunged in the smaller and more luxurious articles;
shirts of heavy silk that crinkled richly between thumb
and finger; wonderful cravats that would almost stand
alone.  Few youngsters attain their desires in this
direction, and Bobo and Jack, long denied, fairly wallowed.
They each bought a valise to carry away their surplus
purchases.
</p>

<p>
In half an hour Bobo was transformed.  To call
Bobo fat was merely to indicate his type.  He was not
all over the place, but a well set-up youngster of a
rather melting style of beauty, which promised obesity
later perhaps, but in youth was not unpleasing.  At
least not in his new clothes.
</p>

<p>
When finally Jack produced the roll of yellow backs
to pay for what they had bought, Bobo's look of anxiety
disappeared and was not seen again.  A little sigh
escaped him.  It was as if he had said:
</p>

<p>
"It is not a dream."
</p>

<p>
Bobo leaving the outfitters was metamorphosed in
more than his apparel.  He stuck his chest out now, and
looked passers-by in the eye.  A stage-English accent
crept into his unadorned Manhattanese.  Jack seeing
him cast sheep's-eyes at a stand of walking-sticks,
purchased him a yellow malacca, such as his own soul had
hankered after earlier in the day.  It was the finishing
touch.  Bobo swung it with a delightful arrogance.  He
even adopted a certain condescension of tone towards
Jack who had no stick.
</p>

<p>
"I say, old chap, these togs are really not half bad
for ready-made, what!  Not what a London tailor
would turn out of course.  But they fit, because I happen
to have a normal figure."
</p>

<p>
"Perfect forty-six," murmured Jack.
</p>

<p>
They returned for their dinner to the famous café
on Bryant Square.  It was the first eating-place in New
York that dared to veil its interior from the vulgar
gaze.  Those alluring, closely-drawn pink curtains cause
the envious poor to suspect the delightful worst.  It is
not so well known in the provinces as flashier resorts,
but it is certainly the place where most New Yorkers
go first when they get money.
</p>

<p>
When they finally penetrated the mystery the plainness
of the interior was rather disappointing, and the
place was almost empty for it was half way between the
dinner and the supper hours.  But the food when it
came justified the café's great reputation.
</p>

<p>
Jack had ordered blindly from the French <i>carte-de-jour</i>,
choosing the most expensive dish from each
subdivision; <i>Petite Marmite; Cotelotte des Ecrivisses au
diable; Filet Mignon au Moelle: pommes de terre
Florizel; Choux-fleur hollandaise; plombière</i>, etc.  The
result was eminently satisfactory.  Bobo groaned with
delight.  It appeared that Bobo had a special and
particular talent for eating.
</p>

<p>
"Don't wake me!  Don't wake me!" he prayed.
"Many's the time I've dreamed of this, but it was
always snatched away just as I sat down.  Say, are we
going to have coffee and cigars?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure thing.  Fifty centers."
</p>

<p>
"O Lord, let me sleep till then and afterwards.  You
can do what you like to me!"
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have a nice taste in fancy eats," said
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"A nice taste!  I was born with the tongue of an
epicure, a delicate tongue, a high-toned tongue!  For
me to be obliged to eat in lunch wagons and beaneries
was a crime against nature!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, how would you like to keep this up for
a while?" said Jack with an offhand air.
</p>

<p>
"Hey?" said Bobo opening his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Jack studied him.  "He's something of a fool," he
thought.  "But maybe that's what I need.  I couldn't
control a hard-headed guy.  And he's an actor.  He
ought to be able to play a part.  And he'd be grateful
for his meals, I could do what I wanted with him.
Anyhow I have to take a chance, and I might do
worse."
</p>

<p>
"What d'ye mean, keep it up?" demanded Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"This is only a sample," said Jack.  "How would
you like the real thing for a while; a suite of rooms at
the Madagascar; a yacht, a motor car&mdash;&mdash;  Oh, half
a dozen motors; all the clothes you wanted from the
best tailor in America; as for the eats&mdash;all you'd have
to do would be press a button and give your order."
</p>

<p>
Bobo turned a little pale.  "What are you getting at?"
</p>

<p>
"Supposing a man offered you this, would you be
willing to put yourself in his hands?"
</p>

<p>
"Say, if it was on the level, he could do what he
wanted with me!" said Bobo fervently.
</p>

<p>
"All right!" said Jack.  "It's a go!"
</p>

<p>
Bobo stared.  "Say, fellow, what kind of a pipe are
you giving me?  Do you mean you are offering
me&mdash;&mdash;  Are you crazy?"
</p>

<p>
"Did you read the afternoon papers?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
Bobo nodded.  "Fellow left his on a bench beside me."
</p>

<p>
"You've never asked me my name."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Jack Norman."
</p>

<p>
Bobo stared speechless.  "On the level?" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
Jack took a couple of letters from his pocket and
showed him the superscriptions.
</p>

<p>
"Jack Norman!" said Bobo.  "Then what were you
loafing in the park by yourself for?"
</p>

<p>
"Trying to get accustomed to the idea."
</p>

<p>
Bobo had no more to say.  He had lost the
condescending air.
</p>

<p>
"Here's the situation," said Jack.  "For certain
reasons which I will explain to you, I want to keep
under cover for a while.  I want to keep my picture
out of the papers.  I don't want to be pointed out and
followed wherever I go.  Well, the easiest way to
escape notice is for me to get some fellow to take my
place, see?"
</p>

<p>
"But everybody who knows you will know I'm not
the real guy."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right.  We won't be moving in the same
circles as I used to.  Want to do it?"
</p>

<p>
"Do I want to do it&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute.  It's only fair to warn you that
old Silas Gyde was croaked by a gang of blackmailers,
and they're after me now."
</p>

<p>
Bobo paled and hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"But I mean to meet all their demands until we nail
them, so there's not much danger."
</p>

<p>
Bobo's face cleared.  "Will I do it&mdash;&mdash;" he began
again.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on!  There are two conditions.  You must
promise to do everything I tell you.  And second, you
are not to marry any woman under false pretences."
</p>

<p>
"I promise," said Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Good!  It's a bargain.  From this moment you
are John Farrow Norman, the newly-made millionaire,
and I am plain Jack Robinson, your secretary."
</p>

<p>
They shook hands across the table.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
As the two young men left the café Bobo said:
"Where are we going now?"
</p>

<p>
"First we must find quarters," said Jack.  "We don't
want to carry these valises around all night."
</p>

<p>
To the chauffeur who opened the taxi door for them
Jack said: "Hotel Madagascar."
</p>

<p>
"My God!" murmured the still dazed Bobo.
</p>

<p>
As they entered the gorgeous lobby of the famous
hotel Bobo was overcome with self-consciousness.  Bobo
had always thought of the Madagascar as the abiding
place of remote and exalted aristocrats.  He slunk at
Jack's heels with the yellow stick trailing limply.
</p>

<p>
"Buck up!  Buck up!" whispered Jack.  "Remember
you are the cheese, and I'm only the mite that lives
off it."
</p>

<p>
"Sure!  Sure!" murmured Bobo, moistening his lips.
</p>

<p>
He made an effort, but quailed again before the
sharp-eyed bell-boys.  Jack reflected that since he was
only supposed to be the millionaire of a day, this
would appear natural enough.
</p>

<p>
"Sign the register," he whispered.  "Remember you
are John Farrow Norman, and I am John Robinson."
</p>

<p>
Bobo accomplished this all right.  As the clerk
nonchalantly spun the card around and read the name, he
caught his breath slightly, and a wonderful silkiness
crept into his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Very pleased to have you with us, sir.  In a way I
hope it's like coming home."
</p>

<p>
The other men behind the desk, arrested by the note
of exceeding deference, made excuses to sidle past and
glance at the register.  Instantly a kind of electric
current charged the office, and was presently communicated
to the bell-boys' bench, whence it spread throughout the
lobby.  "It's Jack Norman," the busy whisper went
around.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you're going to remain with us permanently,
Mr. Norman," added the clerk.  "What accommodations
will you require?"
</p>

<p>
Bobo, child of nature, rebounded like a rubber ball,
feeling the immense respect conveyed by the whole
surrounding atmosphere.  Once more the chest went out,
and the yellow stick was elevated to the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;Er&mdash;my secretary will arrange the details with
you," he drawled, turning away languidly.  One
could see his fingers absently feeling for the monocle
which ought to have been dangling against his
waistcoat button.
</p>

<p>
Jack stepped forward, modest and business-like.
"Mr. Norman wishes to know if the suite occupied by
the late Mr. Gyde is available."
</p>

<p>
"It's empty, I suppose," was the deprecating reply,
"but that is outside my province.  I assure you the
rooms are very undesirable.  Mr. Gyde, you know, was
most eccentric."
</p>

<p>
"But Mr. Norman has been told there was a steel
vault in connection, which he thought might be useful."
</p>

<p>
"Naturally.  Naturally.  Yes, Mr. Gyde had it
installed when the hotel was built.  But there are only
two rooms in the suite, and it does not communicate
directly with any other.  Moreover the bedroom is
quite dark.  It wouldn't do at all."
</p>

<p>
"Hm!" said Jack.  "I suppose not."
</p>

<p>
"But on the same floor, practically adjoining you
might say, there is a magnificent corner-suite of six
rooms&mdash;the finest in the house.  People call it the State
suite.  Prince Boris occupied it on his recent visit, and
the President of Managuay always reserves it."
</p>

<p>
The apparently indifferent Bobo's ears stretched at
this.
</p>

<p>
"The famous Louis Quinze salon with ceilings by
Guglielmetti is included in this suite, and the Dutch
dining-room decorated by Troward Handler Misty.
Each of the bedrooms is done in a different period.  I
assure you there is nothing like it in New York.  It
extends all the way down the south side of the building,
and it is only a matter of cutting diagonally across the
corridor to reach the late Mr. Gyde's suite, which
occupies the back corner of that floor.  Those rooms belong
to Mr. Norman anyway since they were exempted from
our lease.  Together with the state suite they would
make&mdash;but let me have the pleasure of showing them
to you."
</p>

<p>
"What do you think, Mr. Norman?" asked Jack
respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, take them," said Bobo.  "We can change later,
if we're not suited."  He gave the yellow stick a twirl.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, sir."
</p>

<p>
Having been shown up to their magnificent quarters,
Jack firmly dismissed the train of admiring clerks, bell
boys and maids who overwhelmed them with attentions.
Bobo was bearing himself with admirable nonchalance,
but Jack thought he saw signs of a coming crack under
the strain.  There was something comically disproportionate
in the relation of their two little selves and their
two little valises to that endless suite.
</p>

<p>
"Our baggage will come to-morrow," Jack casually
remarked.
</p>

<p>
When they were left alone in the Louis Quinze salon
panelled in blue brocade, they looked around, and they
looked at each other.
</p>

<p>
"Some li'l sittin'-room," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" cried Bobo.  "An hour ago I was sitting
on a bench in Bryant Square with my stomach deflated
like a punctured tube!"
</p>

<p>
"Some rapid rise."
</p>

<p>
Bobo gravely butted his head against the blue satin
brocade.  "Sure if I was asleep, that would wake me up."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, cheer up!  We couldn't both be having the
same dream together."
</p>

<p>
"That's true!" said Bobo, looking wonderfully relieved.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go into the next room," said Jack.  "Louis
Quinze isn't homelike."
</p>

<p>
Entering the Dutch room, he said: "This is rather
classy.  We can have some nice little parties in here."
</p>

<p>
"I wish it was time to eat again," said Bobo with
sudden recollection.  "What a lot of time we waste
digesting!"
</p>

<p>
They were presently informed over the telephone
that Mr. Pope of the <i>Sphere</i> and Mr. Wallis of the
<i>Constellation</i> requested a word or two with Mr. Norman.
</p>

<p>
"The news of our arrival wasted no time in leaking
out," remarked Jack.
</p>

<p>
Looking Bobo over thoughtfully, he decided that
further coaching was necessary before the pseudo-millionaire
could safely be thrown to the reporters.  So
he sent down word that Mr. Norman was out, and to
avoid possible encounters in the lobby, he and Bobo
made their way out by the rear door of the state suite
and thence by Silas Gyde's private stair to the entrance
on the side street.
</p>

<p>
At the Broadway corner they paused.  The sight
of the double procession of automobiles started a new
train of desires.
</p>

<p>
"They ought to keep the automobile show-rooms
open all night," said Jack.  "A fellow wants to buy a
car most after dinner.  I shan't really believe I am a
millionaire&mdash;I mean that you are, until we have a snaky
red roadster with twelve cylinders and a searchlight."
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather have a limousine with blue upholstery
and a chauffeur in blue livery to take the responsibility,"
said Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go as far as you like!  Where will we go now?"
</p>

<p>
"How about the Alpine Heights?"
</p>

<p>
"Lead me to it!"
</p>

<p>
This place of entertainment was on the roof of one
of the theaters.  A discreet privacy shrouded the street
entrance.  They were whirled aloft in an elevator, and
a small army of silver-buttoned boys and lace-capped
maids relieved them of their outer wear.  The
restaurant opened before them like a dream, warm with
perfume and color and softened light.  It was arranged
like a shallow bowl.  The bottom of it was a velvety
dancing-floor, and all around were low terraces of
tables.  Overhead was a balcony, and one end of the
place was closed by a great curtain.  When this was
lifted a sheet of glittering ice was revealed.  The whole
place exhaled luxury like the palace of a satrap.
</p>

<p>
"What a background for the lovely girls!" said Jack.
"But the black coats and pants are out of place here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know!" said Bobo, strutting a little.
</p>

<p>
Jack's sharp eyes perceived that the first and lowest
row of tables was by a process of judicious selection
on the part of the head-waiter, filled with the elite of
the "Broadway crowd," the women exquisite with their
bare shoulders and jewels, the men looking bored and
superior as is expected of super-men.  These people,
as the cunning management of the restaurant well
knew, formed the real attraction to the soberer folk
from out of town, who sat further back drinking it all
in with innocent big eyes.  They thought these fine
folk must be Astorbilts or Vandergelds, whereas they
were more likely Follies of the Circus and Handsome
Harries in funds.
</p>

<p>
The headwaiter with a shrewd glance at the two
young men started to lead them to an obscure corner
(young men unaccompanied do not spend much) but
Jack with a cough attracted his attention and with
discreet motion effected a transfer to his ready hand.
Whereupon after heavy study, the majordomo affected
to discover a vacant table in the second row.  The rail
of the balcony was over their heads.
</p>

<p>
Bobo seized on the bill-of-fare.  "I'm hungry
again!" he cried in the tone of one making an
unexpected and delightful discovery.  "Can I order
anything I want?"
</p>

<p>
"Go to it, son!"
</p>

<p>
"How about champagne?  I never tasted it," he
added naïvely.
</p>

<p>
"What!  Never tasted champagne!"
</p>

<p>
Bobo blushed painfully.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I never did either," said Jack, grinning.
"One bottle because this is a party.  But mind you, the
limit is always one bottle.  We've got head work to do."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, that's right," said Bobo, but without any
great conviction, and Jack reflected that along with
his other pre-occupations he would have to keep an eye
on his partner's potations.
</p>

<p>
Bobo went into conference with the waiter, and in
due course a little Lucullan feast was spread before
them.  It may be remarked in passing, that where his
stomach was concerned Bobo proved to be an
astonishingly apt scholar.  Within a week he was a
menu-card-sharp, and within a month the intimate friend
of every head-waiter on Broadway.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the great curtain was lifted, and enchanting
slender-legged damsels, in chiffons and furs, performed
amazing and graceful evolutions on the ice.  Between
times, the diners danced on the waxed floor.  The
teasing music made Jack think of Kate.  He looked
across the table with distaste.
</p>

<p>
"What wouldn't I give to have her there instead of
that greedy Bobo," he thought.  "Lord!  I suppose I'm
saddled with him now, by day and by night!"
</p>

<p>
During a pause in the music a small object dropped
on their table, bounced and lay still.  It was a piece of
paper folded into a pellet.
</p>

<p>
"A note!" said Bobo excitedly.  "We've made a hit
with somebody.  Is it for you or me do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"You can have my share," said Jack indifferently.
</p>

<p>
Bobo eagerly opened the paper, while Jack's attention
strayed over the crowd.  He wasn't going to allow
the writer of the note to see that the receipt of it
excited him at all, like the foolish Bobo, whose hands
actually were trembling.
</p>

<p>
Jack's glance was sharply recalled by an odd little
sound from his partner.  Bobo's ruddy cheeks had
paled, and his mouth was hanging open stupidly.
</p>

<p>
"Read it," he gasped, handing the note over.
</p>

<p>
It was not what Jack expected.  There was no salutation.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"We have picked up your trail now, and don't you
think we'll ever let it go.  When one of us drops it,
there will be another handy to pick it up.  When the
time comes we'll strike, and there will be another rotten
millionaire the less to sweat the poor.  You will offer
a good-size mark.  You needn't think your skinny
secretary will be any protection.  A hundred like him
wouldn't save you.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"The Red Gang."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
While the tone of the note was the same as the other,
this had been written by an educated hand.  Jack looked
sharply around the nearby tables.  No face betrayed
any self-consciousness.  Behind them sat an honest
couple from the suburbs; in front was a party of eight
in evening dress, the men silly from too much champagne,
the women bored and listless; at their right was
a young couple, wholly and completely absorbed in each
other; at their left, across an aisle, a gay old gentleman
and a languid lady of the chorus&mdash;it seemed hard to
credit that the note could have come from any of these.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do?" murmured Bobo tremulously.
</p>

<p>
"Laugh at it, and let the sender see us laughing,"
said Jack, suiting the action to the word.
</p>

<p>
"It seemed to drop straight down," thought Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"The balcony!" thought Jack.  He rose without any
appearance of haste and made his way up-stairs.  He
had no difficulty in picking out the table that was just
over their heads.  It was now empty.  The napkins lay
where they had been dropped.  He summoned the
waiter.
</p>

<p>
"Who sat at that table?"
</p>

<p>
The man cringed to the authoritative air.  "An elderly
couple, sir.  Never saw them before."
</p>

<p>
"Describe them."
</p>

<p>
"Plain people, sir.  Quietly dressed.  But very
genteel and liberal."
</p>

<p>
This seemed to be about the best the waiter could
do, even with the stimulus of a generous tip.  He did
add that the old gentleman wore a heavy gray mustache
and small imperial.
</p>

<p>
"They have just gone?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Just took the elevator, sir."
</p>

<p>
Jack returned to Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do?" said the fat youth again.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, cheer up!  Everything's going fine!  Don't
you see they've swallowed my bait whole.  They think
<i>you're</i> the millionaire!"
</p>

<p>
"That's fine for you," said Bobo, looking around
nervously, "but where do I get off at?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Next morning the delights of purchasing automobiles
had to be put off a while longer to allow
of some necessary business to be transacted.  Jack
wanted to secure Mr. Delamare's approval for his new
plans.  For obvious reasons he did not care to take
Bobo to the bank, so he called up the financier, and
asked him respectfully if he would mind coming to the
hotel.
</p>

<p>
A laugh answered him over the wire.  "Would I
mind!  My dear boy!  A banker would go to Tallapoosa
to oblige a customer with an account like yours!"
</p>

<p>
While they waited for him they breakfasted in the
Dutch room.  Bobo's appetite showed no evil effects
resulting from his scare of the night before.  During
the meal the card of a visitor was brought them.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
  H. J. WHIGHAM<br />
  <i>The Eureka Protective Association</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Ha!" cried Jack.  "Exactly according to schedule!"
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" asked Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Last night we got the rough stuff, to-day the
smooth."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand."
</p>

<p>
"Keep your ears open, and you'll see.  Just let your
little secretary deal with this gent for you."
</p>

<p>
Jack asked that Mr. Whigham be sent up.  A old-young
man was shown into them, a starched and ironed
little fellow with an air of self-importance like a
cock-sparrow's.
</p>

<p>
"If this is a dangerous crook," thought Jack, "he's
got a dam clever line of comedy.  Looks like a
neck-tie clerk."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Norman?" inquired the newcomer with a
bird-like quirk of the head from one to another.
</p>

<p>
Jack waved his hand in Bobo's direction.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Norman, I have a proposition to make to you."
</p>

<p>
"My secretary will talk to you," said Bobo with the
drawl he now affected.
</p>

<p>
He went on with his breakfast and the reading of
the newspaper&mdash;but missed nothing of what was said.
Jack had been well-advised in keeping from him that
there was any connection between Mr. Whigham and
the Red Gang.  Bobo could scarcely have maintained
that air of nonchalance, had he known it.
</p>

<p>
"What can we do for you?" asked Jack politely
"Excuse me if I go on with my breakfast.  We were
up late last night."
</p>

<p>
"Don't mention it," said Mr. Whigham.  "I am
early.  I came early on purpose, because I thought later
you would be besieged by cranks and triflers of all kinds.
I have a genuine proposition to make Mr. Norman.  It
is one I felt ought to get to him without a moment's
delay."
</p>

<p>
"Open it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Whigham talked smoothly, and at considerable
length.  It had the effect of something well-rehearsed.
Jack, as we know, had it all beforehand.  Only the
essential parts of his spiel need be given.
</p>

<p>
"Both of you gentlemen are no doubt aware of the
great increase of anarchistic activity in this country of
recent years."
</p>

<p>
At the word "anarchistic" Bobo started, and let the
newspaper sink to the table.
</p>

<p>
"The police of this and other cities have worked
hard to check this evil.  They watch the Reds as well
as they are able; close up their meeting-places&mdash;when
they find them; arrest them on the least shadow of
evidence.  This is all right as far as it goes&mdash;understand,
gentlemen, I am not knocking the police; but the fact
remains that the horrible outrages continue.  I need not
speak of the latest one which concerns Mr. Norman so
closely."
</p>

<p>
"The police method is like treating an ulcer with
external applications only.  You may heal it up, but it
will only break out in another place.  Now the Eureka
Association was formed three years ago to deal with
the matter from another angle.  Not in opposition to
the police, nor in alliance with them, but quite
independently.  We never inform on the Reds nor prosecute
them."
</p>

<p>
"You make friends with them?" suggested Jack.
</p>

<p>
"In a way, yes.  Our agents become Reds; join their
circles, watch them, and report to the main office as
to the plots they hatch.  Our organization has now
been brought to such a point of perfection that we are
in a position to guarantee our subscribers absolute
immunity from the attacks of anarchists."
</p>

<p>
"Was the late Mr. Gyde a member?" Jack asked slyly.
</p>

<p>
"He was not," said Mr. Whigham significantly.  "He
had rejected our respectful solicitations from time to
time.  Nevertheless out of pure humanity we warned
him of what was about to occur.  With characteristic
obstinacy he ignored the warning&mdash;well, you know what
happened."
</p>

<p>
"But they say that Emil Jansen, his assailant, was not
a member of any regular circle."
</p>

<p>
"'They say!'" said Mr. Whigham sarcastically.
"What do 'they' know!"
</p>

<p>
"What's the damage?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Hey?" said Mr. Whigham.
</p>

<p>
"What does the service cost?"
</p>

<p>
"Five hundred dollars a month."
</p>

<p>
Jack whistled.  "There's nothing small about you."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Whigham earnestly pointed out the tremendous
expenses attached to the association, including enormous
salaries paid to the special agents to recompense
them for the risks they ran.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you say you wanted to get to us without
loss of time?"
</p>

<p>
"We are informed that a plot is already hatching
against Mr. Norman.  The Reds aim to make a spectacular
double play by getting Mr. Gyde's successor."
</p>

<p>
Bobo gasped and looked imploringly at Jack.
</p>

<p>
"And if Mr. Norman pays up the five hundred you'll
give the plot away?" Jack suggested dryly.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," was the instant reply.  "My instructions
are to give you what information we have in any case.
The Eureka is something more than a sordid money-making
concern.  It supplies a real service to the
community.  For a reference I am instructed to give you
the name of Mr. Walter Delamare, who is well-known
to you."
</p>

<p>
"Hm!" thought Jack.  "This scheme is even cleverer
than I expected."  Aloud he asked: "What is the
information you have?"
</p>

<p>
"That a man will be waiting this morning to attack
Mr. Norman on the steps of the New York National
Bank.  Mr. Norman is advised not to visit Mr. Delamare's
office for the time being."
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" said Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"What is your pleasure in the matter?" Jack asked
Bobo with a respectful air.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, pay him!  Pay him!" was the agitated reply.
</p>

<p>
A pleased faraway look appeared in Mr. Whigham's
eye.  He was evidently figuring on how he
would spend his commission.
</p>

<p>
"Will you sign a check?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
Jack and Bobo went into the next room, and presently
returned with a check, which was handed to
Mr. Whigham.  That little gentleman received it with
thanks, and bowing, left with a promise to send "the
contracts" around as soon as they could be made out.
</p>

<p>
Jack fell into a study.
</p>

<p>
"What do you make of it all?" Bobo asked helplessly.
</p>

<p>
"I may be wrong," said Jack slowly, "but my guess
is that Whigham has a nice little wife and baby, and
lives in a semi-detached with a neat back yard in
Bayonne.  I believe he is a member of the men's bible
class and the Y.M.C.A., and is in every way a decent
little citizen without a suspicion of the real nature of
the devilish business he is engaged in.  We'll have to
look a long way past him for the principal."
</p>

<p>
"Devilish business!" repeated Bobo.  "Don't&mdash;don't
you believe what he said about the Reds being after
you&mdash;I mean me, and all?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a word!  Though I think the worthy little
man believed it himself."
</p>

<p>
"But all that&mdash;about the man waiting on the bank
steps?"
</p>

<p>
"Stage-stuff.  Everybody read in the papers that
Mr. Delamare was Silas Gyde's executor.  A safe guess
that you'd be likely to go to his office to-day.  It was
just a stall.  As a matter of fact, we weren't going
anyway.  Mr. Delamare is coming here."
</p>

<p>
"Just the same, I wouldn't go&mdash;not for all you've
offered me!" said Bobo fervently.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, that's where the pull of the scheme comes in.
Look at it reasonably.  If the anarchists really meant
to croak a millionaire for the good of humanity, as
their letter suggested, would they warn him with a
letter?  Not on your life!  Those letters were simply to
pave the way for Whigham.  But the beauty of the
scheme, the novelty of it, lies in the fact that Whigham
is not in the secret.  They use an innocent little
Sunday-school teacher to collect their tribute!"
</p>

<p>
"Then you think there's no danger?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, danger enough if we had refused to fork out.
There was danger in it for Silas Gyde."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm mighty glad we paid!"
</p>

<p>
"Sure!  Now let me think.  This matter will stand
a lot of doping out."
</p>

<p>
They soon began to experience the full effects of
newspaper publicity.  A crowd of newspaper reporters,
solicitors, cranks, high-toned beggars, besieged the
hotel, and in every delivery arrived a stack of letters a
foot high.
</p>

<p>
The hotel management designated its most experienced
bellboy to wait upon them exclusively.  This
youth, Ralph by name, was smart and good-looking,
but he had too knowing an eye.  His knowledge of life,
particularly of the seamy side of life, was disconcerting.
Jack felt impelled to warn Bobo to be guarded in
Ralph's presence.  Jack decided they would have to
forego the luxury of personal servants.  The danger
of the betrayal of their secret was too great.
</p>

<p>
After schooling Bobo for the ordeal, Jack had the
reporters up-stairs, but excluded photographers.  Bobo
acquitted himself well enough in the interviews that
followed.  True he turned to Jack for aid at every other
question, but there was nothing in itself suspicious that
the newly-made millionaire seemed to be of a soft and
dependent character.  Jack could see the eyes of the
reporters turn on himself enviously.  They seemed to
be saying:
</p>

<p>
"Gee!  This guy has fallen into a good thing!  He
runs the show!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Delamare arrived in company with Hugh
Brome, Jack's lawyer, and the reporters were politely
ushered out.  Bobo was introduced to the newcomers,
and Jack explained the part he was to play.  They
stared&mdash;then they laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Is it all right?" asked Jack anxiously.  "Do you
approve?"
</p>

<p>
"You're keeping the check signing privilege in your
own hands I assume," said Mr. Delamare.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
"Well, as your banker that's all I'm concerned with.
As your friend I may say I think it's a good scheme.
You will have a close, outside view of a millionaire's
life that will be of inestimable service to you when you
have to take up that life."
</p>

<p>
Jack told him of the call of the Eureka Protective
Association's representative, and mentioned that his,
Mr. Delamare's name, had been offered as a reference.
</p>

<p>
The banker smote his palm with his fist.  "By Gad! it's
a fact!" he said.  "I had forgotten all about it.  I
subscribed three years ago, after poor Ames Benton's
death when we were all scared, and I suppose the
payments have been going on ever since by my orders.  At
the time I thought the scheme was on the square, and
I have never thought about it since.  But they didn't
tax me anything like as much as you.  I suppose their
ideas were more modest at the beginning.  I must put
a stop to my contributions."
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't it be better to wait until I have looked into
the thing?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Delamare shook his head decisively.  "I can't stand
for anything like that."
</p>

<p>
Having obtained the approval of his banker and
his lawyer for his plans, Jack felt encouraged to go
ahead.  As Delamare and Brome were leaving Jack
said:
</p>

<p>
"Can either of you put me in touch with a high police
official, a man I can apply to in case of need?"
</p>

<p>
"I know the third deputy commissioner," said Delamare.
"I'll give you a note to him."
</p>

<p>
When Jack and Bobo started out on the automobile
buying expedition they left the Madagascar by the front
door.
</p>

<p>
"The back door must be saved for emergencies,"
said Jack.  "We'll have to get used to running the
gauntlet."
</p>

<p>
However since no photographs had yet been published
they were not generally recognized in the lobby.
They only had one encounter.  That was in that
well-known cross corridor behind the lobby, where under the
softly shaded lights amidst tropical verdure lovely
ladies await their companions for luncheon and tea.
As Bobo and Jack passed through one of these, a really
dazzling creature in an ermine cape jumped up from
her fauteuil.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Norman!" she cried, addressing Bobo.  "I'm
sure I can't be mistaken!"
</p>

<p>
Bobo fell back in dismay.  Jack looked on with a
twinkle.  It was not up to him to rescue his partner.
The lady was of that highly-finished type that defies
time&mdash;for a long time.  She might have been twenty-eight
or thirty-eight.  For furs, millinery and hairdressing
one couldn't see much of the woman God
made, except a pair of big blue eyes, the whites slightly
discolored from make-up.  Her clothes outstyled
style&mdash;but all was in good taste.  It looked like the real
thing.
</p>

<p>
"I am Clara Birmingham that was," she went on.
"Don't you remember me?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I can't say I do," stammered Bobo ungallantly.
</p>

<p>
She laughed charmingly.  "Well, it's not surprising,
since we were both children when I used to visit
Cartonsville.  I recognized you from your likeness to your
mother.  You must come to see me.  I am Mrs. Anson
Cleaver now.  You'll find me in the 'phone book.  By
the way, I'm having some people in to-night for music.
Can't you come?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I&mdash;I&mdash;Mr. Robinson and I have an engagement."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cleaver turned inquiringly towards Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Robinson, my secretary," explained Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Bring him with you.  I should be charmed!"
</p>

<p>
With that she sailed away.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she was out of sight Bobo became very
bold and looked at Jack with a doggish air, as much
as to say: "That's the way to handle them!"  But
Jack laughed, and he wilted rather.
</p>

<p>
"Can we go to-night?" he asked meekly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you want to go now."
</p>

<p>
"It would be sport, wouldn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll see."
</p>

<p>
Later he went into a booth and called up Mr. Delamare.
</p>

<p>
"This is Robinson," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Robinson?" came the puzzled reply.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Norman's secretary."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course!" with a laugh.  "What can I do for you?"
</p>

<p>
"I come to you in every difficulty."
</p>

<p>
"That's as it should be.  What now?"
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever hear of a lady called Mrs. Anson
Cleaver?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely!  Everybody has heard of Mrs. Cleaver.
It's easy to see you don't read the society columns."
</p>

<p>
"She's the real thing, then."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;not quite.  Owing to the publicity she gets,
she passes in the mind of the public as one of our
leaders.  But they say she has rather a strangely
assorted crowd at her house, and conservative ladies&mdash;like
Mrs. Delamare, are a little, what shall I say, leery
of her.  Nothing against her reputation you understand,
but she's considered a little too spectacular in her
methods."
</p>

<p>
"She made out to recognize Bobo from his likeness
to my mother, and asked us to a musicale to-night.  I
thought she was a crook."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hardly that!  That was only a ladies' lie.
Perfectly justifiable under the circumstances."
</p>

<p>
"What circumstances?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow!  You forget the éclat of a hundred
millions!  Think what a drawing card you&mdash;I mean
Bobo&mdash;will be at her entertainments.  She intends to
be the first to exhibit him."
</p>

<p>
"Then you think it will be all right for us to go?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  It will be amusing&mdash;and it can't very
well do you any harm."
</p>

<p>
Just the same when Jack hung up the receiver a
doubt remained in his mind.  "How did it happen she
picked on Bobo with such certainty?" he wondered.
"No photograph has been published."
</p>

<p>
There followed a delightful orgy of spending during
which Jack threw off all cares.  The whole of automobile
row from Fiftieth street to Seventy-second seemed
to have been forewarned of their coming, and their
progress was like a triumphal procession.  The sleek,
exquisite, expensive cars were put through their paces
like willing slaves awaiting a master.  Failing to agree
on a type they bought both Jack's dashing roadster and
Bobo's Imperial limousine.
</p>

<p>
They spent several hours with a millionaire's tailor,
Bobo with ecstatic eyes like a dreamer, choosing suit
after suit.  Finally they purchased the best ready-made
outfit obtainable for the party that night.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Jack and Bobo dined in the main restaurant of the
Madagascar.  By this time they were pretty well
known in the hotel, and curious envious glances
followed them wherever they went.  It was meat and
drink to Bobo, though he affected to be much annoyed
by it.
</p>

<p>
"What do you suppose they're staring at," he
drawled.
</p>

<p>
"Your fatal beauty," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Evening dress had gone to Bobo's head somewhat.
The big white shirt front puffed out alarmingly.
Among his new possessions was a fine watch that he
drew out to consult every three minutes or so.  He
could not contain his impatience to get to the party.
</p>

<p>
"Hadn't we better be moving?"
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!  It isn't eight o'clock.  What do you
think this is, an M. E. social?"
</p>

<p>
"What time are you going, then?"
</p>

<p>
"About ten, I should say.  The later we come, the
more effect it will have."
</p>

<p>
"How will we put in the time until then?"
</p>

<p>
"I have another date.  I'll take you along with me."
</p>

<p>
Bobo, when he forgot himself, dropped into his
usual Tenderloin slang.  "Gee!  I always wanted to go
into society.  I felt I was fitted for it.  I like
everything of the choicest.  These common mutts gimme a
pain.  I'll show the swell guys a thing or two to-night.
They'll have to hand it to me."
</p>

<p>
"You'd better cut out the guys and the gimmes,"
suggested Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I've got a line of classy talk all right when I
need it.  Wasn't I dresser for Bill Calverly the matinee
idol season before last.  He used to show me all his
mash notes.  How's this?"
</p>

<p>
Bobo screwed an imaginary monocle into his eye, and
was suddenly prostrated with languor.  "&mdash;Er&mdash;How-de-do,
Mrs. Cleaver.  So sorry we were late.  But a
lawyer fellow turned up just as I was leaving my hotel,
and I couldn't put him off.  Business is such a bother,
isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Great!" said Jack dryly, "but tip me a wink before
you begin so I can beat it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you've got to back me up!" said Bobo, suddenly
scared and natural.  "For the love of Mike don't leave
me stranded on the grand stairway."
</p>

<p>
Bobo's limousine, the perfection of luxury and elegance,
was waiting for them in front of the hotel.  Bobo
in silk hat, evening overcoat, fluffy white scarf, and
white kids, with the inevitable yellow stick crooked over
his arm enjoyed a wonderful moment standing on the
top step of the Madagascar waiting for his car to pull
up.  He flicked the ash from his cigarette, and the
humble pedestrians looked up admiringly.
</p>

<p>
It is not vouchsafed to many of us so completely
to realize our dreams.  Bobo's dream was based on the
cigarette advertisements in color on the back covers
of popular magazines.  Jack, similarly attired, watched
him with a twinkle from a respectful stand to the rear.
In his enjoyment of the situation he was perfectly
content to play a secondary part.  It was lots more fun, he
thought, to pull the wires from behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
When they got in the car Jack gave the chauffeur
an address on East 69th Street.
</p>

<p>
"What are we going to Yorkville for?" asked Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"To see an old friend."
</p>

<p>
"I hate to leave the white lights."
</p>

<p>
Bobo insisted on keeping the dome light burning.
Jack suspected that the real reason his heart had been
set on a limousine was that the wide windows afforded
the populace every facility to see him pass in his glory.
</p>

<p>
They drew up before a cheap apartment house, one
of a long row in an untidy street.
</p>

<p>
"Gee! what a crummy joint!" said Bobo fastidiously.
</p>

<p>
"It would have seemed plenty good enough yesterday,"
said Jack coldly.
</p>

<p>
Jack had no desire to take Bobo up-stairs with him.
"You stay here till I come down," he said.  "I may be
an hour, but you've got plenty of cigars.  Take a
snooze.  We'll be up late."
</p>

<p>
In the vestibule Jack searched among the double row
of labels for the name that made his heart beat
faster&mdash;Storer.  Pressing the bell button, presently an
answering click in the door latch informed him that the
way in was open.  He made his way up four flights of
narrow ill-lighted stairs with a dirty carpet.  Through
the thin doors issued the sounds of incontinent domestic
broils, and every landing offered the nose a different
smell&mdash;but all unpleasant.  Jack shuddered&mdash;not because
he couldn't endure the smells, but at the thought
that his dear and dainty Kate was obliged to dwell
among them.
</p>

<p>
Kate opened the door, a rare vision in that grimy
frame.  At the sight of Jack's regalia she quailed a
little, but quickly recovered herself.  Jack would have
kissed her if she had given him the least opening, but
she did not.  She invited him in with an air better than
Mrs. Cleaver's.  Once the door closed the squalor was
forgotten.  It was a lady's room, however small and
poorly furnished.
</p>

<p>
"How grand we are!" said Kate chaffingly.
</p>

<p>
Jack explained where he was going later.
</p>

<p>
"I'll call Mother," said Kate.  "She has been
anxious to meet you."
</p>

<p>
"Wait!" said Jack.  "You must introduce me as
Mr. Robinson."
</p>

<p>
Kate frowned.  "Must?  To Mother?  I can't do that."
</p>

<p>
"I'll explain&mdash;&mdash;" began Jack.
</p>

<p>
But at that moment the old lady walked in.
</p>

<p>
She was a dear little old lady, the old-fashioned kind
of mother, quite rare in a New York flat.  She wore a
black silk dress many times turned and white at the
seams, and a little cap which was never quite straight,
giving her a lovable, rakish expression.
</p>

<p>
Jack looked appealingly at Kate, who hesitated and
gulped.  "Mother, this&mdash;this is Mr. Robinson," she
said.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, Mr. Robinson," said Mrs. Storer
in a voice like a little girl's.  She affected to take no
notice of Jack's grandeur though it must surely have
been a notable sight in that poor little room.  "I have
not heard Katherine speak of you.  Where did you
meet Mr. Robinson, Katherine?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Robinson was&mdash;was formerly in our office,"
said poor Kate.
</p>

<p>
The little old lady made polite conversation for five
minutes, and then having established the proprieties,
like a thoroughbred mother, she made a transparent
excuse to disappear and was seen no more.
</p>

<p>
"She's a corker!" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Kate beamed on him.
</p>

<p>
Through the open window came the sounds of a violent,
vulgar altercation from the flat below.  Kate
closed the window with an oblivious air.
</p>

<p>
"I expect you've had an exciting day," she said.
"What did the papers mean by saying that you were
fat, and that you had a good-looking secretary to whom
you turned for everything?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm the good-looking one," said Jack, grinning.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand."
</p>

<p>
"I'll explain in a minute, but first&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Please!</i>" she said with an admonishing gesture.
</p>

<p>
"Kitty, I can't help it!  I can't play up to you.  If
you knew how it hurt to find you living in such a
place&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We don't have to live here," she said with quick
pride.  "We're saving our money so we can go
abroad."
</p>

<p>
"That's not true.  I know how much they pay in
the sort of place where you work, and how much it
costs to live.  I have been through the mill.  It takes
every cent you earn to keep up this place.  And you're
always thinking, what would you do if you got sick or
were without a job, even for a week.  That's what
makes that little line between your dear eyes."
</p>

<p>
Kate laughed delicately.  "Mercy, you're quite a
mind-reader!"
</p>

<p>
Jack floundered on.  "And me with all this rotten
money!  Every cent I spend shames me, thinking of
you here&mdash;and your mother."
</p>

<p>
"You haven't spent any since you met Mother,
have you?" she suggested maliciously.
</p>

<p>
"Don't tease me!  I'm in earnest.  Why will you be
so silly?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you proposing that I accept a gift of some of
your new riches?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm proposing that you accept me."
</p>

<p>
"I would never marry a man that pitied me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Kate!" he said, graveled and reproachful.
"How silly!"
</p>

<p>
Then he got his wind again.  "That's only putting
me off.  What's pity got to do with it or anything?  I
just want you!"
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you ask me when you were poor?" she
murmured.
</p>

<p>
"How could I?  I could scarcely keep myself."
</p>

<p>
"Then I am just a sort of luxury."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Kitty!  How unjust!  You take a delight in
putting me in the wrong!"
</p>

<p>
"It's no use," she said with a firm shake of the
head.  "I haven't changed since yesterday.  If you
insist on bringing this up every day, it will only have
the effect of spoiling my naturally amiable temper.
Let's change the subject.  Tell me all your adventures
since yesterday."
</p>

<p>
He was no match for her.  He had to obey.
</p>

<p>
But if she was cruel in other respects, she made a
rare listener.  Her eyes sparkled and her soft cheeks
glowed with excitement as his tale unfolded.  When
the devilish workings of the blackmailing scheme were
made clear to her, her indignation knew no bounds.
</p>

<p>
"The wretches!  The <i>beasts</i>!" she murmured.  "Oh,
they must not be allowed to go free.  That poor, lonely
old man!  It is fine of you to pledge yourself to run
them down.  It's a crusade in a way, isn't it&mdash;and a
dangerous one!"  She gave him an extraordinary look
through her lashes.  "Come to me after you have
done your work," she murmured, "and perhaps my
answer will be different!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Kate!" he said, reaching for her hand.
</p>

<p>
She neatly evaded him.  "Afterwards, I said.  Now
tell me what you mean to do."
</p>

<p>
He told her.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could help!" she said involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
Jack had a dazzling inspiration.  It must have been
his good fairy that sent him that lovely idea all
complete and ready to work.  "Why, you can help!" he
cried.
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
He made out, of course, that the idea had been in
his head all the time.  "Listen.  As Jack Norman's
secretary I'm bound to become a pretty well-known
figure around town, and it stands to reason I can't do
much sleuthing in that character.  I've get to have a
disguise.  I've got to lead a double life.  I'll work while
Bobo sleeps."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but what has that got to do with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Listen, I'm coming to that.  I've told you about
our suite at the Madagascar, and Silas Gyde's two
little rooms, and the secret way into the house next
door.  Now, you see, I'll go to bed in the hotel as
Jack Norman's secretary, and in the morning I'll come
out of the house next door prepared for work in
another character."
</p>

<p>
"But what am I to do?"
</p>

<p>
"That house belongs to me, you know, though the
deed has never been transferred.  You must appear to
rent it, furnish it and open it as a first-class
boarding-house&mdash;no, furnished apartments would be easier for
you."
</p>

<p>
"But"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute.  Then I can rent the second floor
rear from you in my new character.  I can pass back
and forth through the vault as I like, and no one can
possibly trace the connection between Jack Norman's
secretary and the sober little business man who lives
in your house.  See?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I couldn't!"
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Mother wouldn't like it.  And I&mdash;I'm not fitted
for that sort of thing."
</p>

<p>
"You could make a bluff at it.  You said you wanted
to help."
</p>

<p>
"But would it be helping?  I think you're just
trying to make an excuse to get us out of this place."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!  I had it in mind before I ever came
to-night.  It's absolutely necessary to the success of
my plans!"
</p>

<p>
"You're just trying to get around me."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not!  How could I trust anybody else with the
secret of that vault?"
</p>

<p>
Jack had struck the right line at last.  She could
not resist this subtle form of flattery, and in the end
she gave in.  "But I warn you I'll make that house
pay," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go as far as you like."
</p>

<p>
They discussed their arrangements in detail.  Once
she had consented, Kate entered into it with a will.  In
the midst of their talk a clock struck one.
</p>

<p>
"Half-past nine!" said Jack, starting up.  "I clean
forgot Bobo downstairs!"
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you bring him up?" said Kate.  "I'm
curious to see him."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said Jack, "but for once I wanted to
play first fiddle myself."
</p>

<p>
At the door he gave her her final instructions.  "You
will start in to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said promptly.  "I know a girl that will
be pleased to pieces to substitute for me at the
typewriter."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'll never go back there," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"We'll see," she said demurely.  As a matter of fact
her heart was singing at the prospect of release from
horrible monotony.
</p>

<p>
"My lawyer will come here in the morning with the
keys and the necessary funds," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't have him come here.  I'll go to his office."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, if you'd rather.  I'll write down the
address.  You and I mustn't see each other again,
until I come to you to apply for a room.  Can you open
up in three days?"
</p>

<p>
"Three days!" she cried, aghast.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, things are made easy for you, I find, when
you have the coin."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll try."
</p>

<p>
Jack went down the stairs two steps at a time,
not at all displeased with himself.  Had he not
rescued Kate from her squalid surroundings, and made
sure of being able to see her as often as he wanted?
Let her fight him as she would, she was his partner
already.  She must come all the way some day soon.
It was silly for her to make out she didn't mind
poverty.  She had given it away, in spite of herself.
</p>

<p>
The elegant limousine still rested at the curb, the
chauffeur fast asleep in the corner of the front seat.
The dome light was now out and Jack could not see
into the body of the car.  He was astonished when he
opened the door to find it empty.  The chauffeur woke
up instinctively.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Mr. Norman?" demanded Jack, staring
at the spot where he ought to have been.
</p>

<p>
"'Deed I don't know, sir.  He was inside, all right,
when I dropped off.  I heard you tell him to take a
snooze, so I thought I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, that's all right," said Jack.  "He's big enough
to take care of himself."
</p>

<p>
He looked anxiously up and down the street, but
there was no sign of his silk-hatted friend.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Jack was at a loss which way to turn.  Suddenly at
a street level window of the apartment house he
had just left, he saw a fat woman resting her folded
arms on a pillow on the sill.  She looked as if she
had been there for hours.  He approached, lifting
his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, madam, but did you see my friend get
out of the car?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, I see him," she replied in scornful accents.
"Didn't he get out and walk up and down gapping and
stretching like he was tired of waiting for you!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," murmured Jack.  She seemed to expect
it.  Then: "Which way did he go?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, a fellow come along from Lexington avenue
way, and they got into talk like.  The fellow said:
'Fine night, friend.'  And your friend said: 'Right
you are!'  One thing led to another, and the fellow
said: 'That your car?'  And your friend says: 'One of
them.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the fool!" groaned Jack inwardly.  Aloud he
asked: "When was this?"
</p>

<p>
"Half an hour ago, maybe.  And the fellow says:
'What make is it?'  'Goodwin twelve, ninety horse,'
said the other fellow.  And&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know, but which way did they go?"
</p>

<p>
But the fat woman was not going to be cheated of
the telling of her tale.  "I'm coming to that.  And the
fellow said&mdash;I don't mean your friend, but the other
fellow, he said: 'She's new, ain't she?'  And the other
fellow said, that's the swell guy I'm referrin' to, the
swell guy says: 'Just out of the shop!'  Bye and bye
the fellow said: 'Will you drink with me?  And your
friend says: 'Sure!'  And they went in the side door
of the saloon on the corner yonder."
</p>

<p>
"Much obliged," said Jack, darting across the road.
</p>

<p>
His quarry had flown.  There were half a dozen
men lined up before the mahogany, but Bobo was not
among them.  Neither was he in the small sitting-room
behind.  Jack applied himself to the white-jacketed
bar-tender.
</p>

<p>
"Did a friend of mine come in here about half an
hour ago?"
</p>

<p>
"Fellow dressed like yourself?"
</p>

<p>
Jack nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, he come in here with a little guy with a
bad eye."
</p>

<p>
"What d'ye mean, bad eye?"
</p>

<p>
"Crooked.  He had a face you could break rocks
on.  I thought at the time it was a case of a come-on,
but it weren't my place to interfere.  'Specially as your
friend seemed sober enough.  But he certainly was
lappin' 'em up!"
</p>

<p>
Jack began to get seriously anxious.
</p>

<p>
"They downed four whiskeys in less'n ten minutes.
Least your friend did.  Little guy just tasted hisn.
Then they left."
</p>

<p>
"Where did they go?"
</p>

<p>
"Search me!  Little guy says he knows a better place
down the Avenue, but I didn't hear the name of it.
Swell guy says he can't go because he's waiting for his
friend, but little fellow says: 'Ahh, we'll be back in
fifteen minutes', and swell guy says: 'He's callin' on a
dame acrost the street, so I guess he's good for
another half hour.'  Then they went out the front door."
</p>

<p>
One of the regulars of the place who had heard
Jack's inquiry took up the story here.  "They got in
a taxi-cab," he said.  "I was watching out of the
window.  It was Gus Harris' car, it was."
</p>

<p>
"Gus'll tell you where he took 'em," said the
bar-tender soothingly.
</p>

<p>
"He'll be back in a minute if he don't pick up another
fare in the street," the other speaker said.  "Just
stick around awhile."
</p>

<p>
By this time everybody present was interested in
Jack's quest.  "Here he is!  Here's Gus!" half a dozen
voices cried, as a battered taxi-cab came to a stand
before the door.  They all followed him out on the
pavement.
</p>

<p>
"Did you pick up a friend of mine here?" asked
Jack of the driver.
</p>

<p>
"You know, Gus.  Swell guy with the tile and the
wedding fixings," some one added.
</p>

<p>
"Sure!" said Gus.
</p>

<p>
"Where did you take him?"
</p>

<p>
"McGann's, Third near Fifty-Eighth."
</p>

<p>
The name had an ominous ring.  "McGann's?" said
Jack.  "Hasn't that place a bad name?"
</p>

<p>
"The worst in town," said Gus cheerfully.  "Want
me to take you there?"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, my own car is around the corner," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
He hastened to it.
</p>

<p>
Jack's heart sank at the aspect of McGann's.  Never
had he been in a place better suited to deeds of evil.
In front there was an ordinary bar of the humbler kind.
It was empty except for the bartenders busy pouring
drinks, which were carried behind a screen at the rear
by a waiter whose blotched face and furtive eyes
suggested an unimagined degradation.  Bartender and
waiter stared at Jack with a sneer.
</p>

<p>
"What, another!" the former said under his breath.
</p>

<p>
Behind the screen Jack found himself in a big,
low-ceiled room set with tables more than half filled with
drinkers of both sexes.  The walls were dark and
greasy, the air thick with the smoke of unspeakable
cigars.  The strangest feature of the place was the
silence that filled it.  The drinkers for the most part
sat huddled in their chairs with eyes cast down or
caps pulled low.  When they conversed it was in
hoarse whispers.  When one wanted more drink he
held up a finger.  It was a strange scene of merrymaking.
</p>

<p>
The presiding genius of the place was a head-waiter
or "bouncer," who did not soil his hands with
serving, but lolled about the place watching his patrons
with a hard, ironical eye like an animal-trainer.  Jack,
instinctively lowering his voice to suit the hushed air
of the place, addressed his usual question to this
individual.
</p>

<p>
The man looked him over insolently before replying.
A defiant sneer turned the corners of his lips.
"He ain't been here," he said curtly.  His look said:
"Sure, I'm lying.  What are you going to do about it?"
</p>

<p>
Jack flushed, and clenched his teeth.  Turning his
back on the man, he addressed the room at large with
raised voice.
</p>

<p>
"I'm looking for a friend of mine.  Young fellow
about twenty-four, full habit, red cheeks, wearing a
silk hat, white muffler, black overcoat.  Have any of
you seen him?  I'll pay for information."
</p>

<p>
Those huddled around the walls stirred in discomfort
at the sound of a voice so boldly raised in that
place of whispers.  None answered Jack.  None would
look at him directly.  The bouncer laughed unpleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"Are you satisfied?  Now you can get out!"
</p>

<p>
It was galling to Jack's pride, but he saw nothing
for it but to obey.  He walked out slowly with as
much dignity as a man could muster under the
circumstances.  He was in horrid expectation of a cowardly
kick from behind.  But he would not turn around.
</p>

<p>
He paused in front of the place, and looked up and
down for a policeman.  While he stood there one of
the furtive figures slouched out of the doorway behind
him, and without stopping, whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Follow me a little way, and I'll tell you."
</p>

<p>
The man led him into the shadow of a nearby doorway.
There were plenty of people passing, and Jack's
own chauffeur was still within hail.  He was not
under any apprehension of an attack.
</p>

<p>
"Is it worth a fiver to you?" the man whined.  "McGann
would half kill me if he knew I told."
</p>

<p>
Jack displayed a five-dollar bill.  "It is worth a
fiver," he said, "but I'll hang on to it, until I hear what
you have to say."
</p>

<p>
"That's fair enough.  Your friend come into
McGann's about half an hour back.  He was with a
guy that's well known there.  Wouldn't do you no
good to know his name.  He's a friend of the boss
and a bad egg.  They had one or two and your friend
got groggy."
</p>

<p>
"Doped?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
The man shrugged.  "I didn't name it.  Pretty soon
the fellow that brought him there says to Stinger&mdash;Stinger's
the big guy, the bouncer there&mdash;he says to
Stinger: 'Me friend's real sick,' he says.  'We better
put him to bed.'  We all knows what that means."
</p>

<p>
"What does that mean?" demanded Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they was just going to roll him.  But just as
they was liftin' him up, a stranger come in, old man
short and stoutish with a big mustache and a little
chin whisker, not to say a swell guy but dressed real
decent and genteel-like.  He was old, but My God! he
had his nerve with him.
</p>

<p>
"'Put that man down,' says he.
</p>

<p>
"'W'at the Hell is it to you?' says Stinger.
</p>

<p>
"'He's a friend of mine,' the old feller says; 'I'll
take him home.'
</p>

<p>
"'The Hell you will!' says Stinger.  'Get out of
here before I throw you out!'
</p>

<p>
"'You won't do that,' the old man says, smiling
real polite.
</p>

<p>
"Then Stinger makes for him.  The old guy pulled
a police whistle.  Stinger slung a chair at him, but he
ducked the chair, and blew his whistle.  The guy that
brought your friend in, and some other guys that was
wanted, beat it out the back way.  The rest of us
just sat there.  Stinger rushed the old guy, but he
pulled a gun and backed him off.
</p>

<p>
"Well, a cop come running in, and here's the funny
part.  The old guy didn't make out to lay no charge
against Stinger, but all of a sudden he made out to be
friends with him.  The old guy says:
</p>

<p>
"'Sorry to trouble you, officer, but I had a friend
here fightin' drunk, and he tried to make a rough-house
when I wanted him to come home.  But he's all in now;
he won't give no more trouble.  Just help me carry
him out to my car, will you?'
</p>

<p>
"Well, the cop on this beat didn't want to get in
wrong with McGann, and Stinger didn't want no
trouble with the police neither.  So it all ended
friendly-like.  The cop and Stinger carried your friend out
between them, and put him in the old guy's automobile.
But say, Stinger cursed the old guy good when
he was gone.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know where they took my friend?" Jack
asked.
</p>

<p>
The man shrugged.  "Headed downtown," he said.
"That's all I know.  But I took good note of the car,
if it's any good to you.  It was one of these here, now,
limousines, like yours yonder, but with a long body like
a private ambulance, and painted black.  It carried a
Connecticut license."
</p>

<p>
"What number?"
</p>

<p>
"Ahh!  I didn't have no pencil to take it down.  I
forget."
</p>

<p>
This was all the information Jack could extract.
He handed over the bill, and the man scuttled away.
Jack returned to his car, and stood with his foot on
the running-board, trying to plan out some reasonable
course of action.
</p>

<p>
"Old man, short and thick-set," he thought, "heavy
mustache and a little chin whisker; sounds like our
friend who dropped us the note last night.  Looks
like out of the frying-pan into the fire for Bobo.  But
why should the Red Gang kidnap him when we've paid
up?  Maybe my whole theory of the case is wrong."
</p>

<p>
He could think of nothing better to do than go to
Police Headquarters and send out an alarm for a
long black limousine with a Connecticut license.  This
would play havoc with his carefully laid plans.
Nevertheless he was about to give the order to his chauffeur,
when a boy of the street stopped beside him, and with
inimitable grinning impudence said:
</p>

<p>
"Say, fella, you'll find what you're lookin' for at
the Hotel Madagascar."
</p>

<p>
Jack, greatly startled, caught the boy by the arm.
"Here, you, give an account of yourself!" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
The boy wriggled in his grasp and whimpered:
"Ahh!  I ain't done nottin'!"
</p>

<p>
"Who told you to tell me that?"
</p>

<p>
"Old guy in a big black limousine.  Lemme go!  I
ain't done nottin'!"
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"At the next corner there.  I was just standin' there
when the car come acrost Third and stopped beside
me.  Old guy stuck his head out and ast me did I want
to make half a dollar.  I says sure.  And he gimme
it.  And he says tell that guy in the silk hat standin'
by the car in front of McGann's that he'll find what
he's lookin' for at the Hotel Madagascar.  Then he
spoke to his shuffer and they went on towards the
Bridge."
</p>

<p>
"Was he alone in the car?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  Except the shuffer."
</p>

<p>
Jack was at a loss how much of this to believe.  As
a matter of precaution, he decided to hang on to
the boy for the present.  "You come along with me,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
The boy obeyed with mixed feelings.  He was still
scared, but the prospect of such a ride cheered him.
His attitude persuaded Jack that his tale was probably
true.  If he had had any connection with the Red
Gang, he would scarcely have yielded himself up to
Jack so willingly.  Jack gave the word to return to
the Madagascar.  As they drove off the boy waved his
hand to his envious companions in the street.  At the
hotel, Jack left him in charge of the chauffeur.
</p>

<p>
He found Bobo safe on his own bed.
</p>

<p>
Inquiry at the office revealed the fact that half an
hour before he had been brought home very much the
worse for wear by an elderly friend, who departed
as soon as he had put him in his room.  Jack dismissed
the boy and sent the car to the garage.
</p>

<p>
Returning to their suite, Jack gazed grimly at the
recumbent Bobo, who appeared to have suffered no
permanent harm.  He lay sprawling on the bed, breathing
stertorously.  The big white shirt bosom was rumpled
and stained.  His overcoat lay in a heap beside
the bed.  Jack was greatly relieved, but indignant,
and more puzzled than ever.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't suspect our friend with the imperial of
being a philanthropist," he thought.  "His letters
certainly didn't read that way.  Why the deuce did he
take the risk of kidnapping Bobo from McGann's if he
only meant to bring him home?  It beats the Dutch!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Bobo sat up with a grunt.  "Wassa
matter?" he asked thickly.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I'd like to know," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Recollection returned to Bobo in a flash, and he
clapped his head between his hands.  "Lord!  But
I'm sick!" he groaned hollowly.
</p>

<p>
"Get up," said Jack coldly.  "Go into the bathroom,
and stick your head in cold water.  I'll send for a
pot of coffee for you."
</p>

<p>
Bobo put a hand to his waistcoat pocket, and seemed
about to burst into tears.  "My watch is gone!" he
wailed.
</p>

<p>
"You're lucky to be here yourself!  A nice chase
you've led me!"
</p>

<p>
"What time is it?"
</p>

<p>
Jack consulted his watch.  "Ten-fifteen.  It's been
a busy forty-five minutes!"
</p>

<p>
It was a much chastened Bobo that presently
returned to the room.  "What happened to me?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you.  You fell into the hands of the Red
Gang, that's all; the same little gentleman with the
Imperial that dropped us a line last night.  Why, after
capturing you, he was content to give you up again, I
don't know."
</p>

<p>
Bobo turned pale, and his knees weakened under
him.  He dropped in a chair.  "The Red Gang!" he
murmured.  "Oh, my God!  Never again!  Never
again, s'elp me Bob!  Never another drop unless you
are right there to take care of me!"
</p>

<p>
Jack grunted scornfully.
</p>

<p>
Jack picked up the overcoat from the floor.  As he
did so, he discovered a piece of white paper pinned
to the lapel.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  Maybe this is the key to the mystery!" he
cried, pouncing on it.
</p>

<p>
It was written upon by the same hand that had
indited the note of the night before.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>To the Secretary:</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>For Heaven's sake try to teach this addle-pate the
danger of drinking with strangers.  His foolishness
to-night almost wrecked all our plans.  We have saved
him from the worst den of thugs in New York, not
from any love of him, you may be sure, but because
when the right time comes we mean to get him ourselves.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>The Red Gang.</i>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Oh, Lor'!  Oh, Lor'!  Oh, Lor'!" groaned Bobo.
"What's the use!  They'll get me anyhow!"
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"What are you laughing at?  I don't see anything
to laugh at."
</p>

<p>
"Cheer up!  This doesn't exactly mean what it says.
I see it all now."
</p>

<p>
"What does it mean then?" said Bobo irritably.
</p>

<p>
"It means your skin is worth five hundred a month
to the Red Gang, and they've no notion of letting
McGann's crew damage their property!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
12
</h3>

<p>
Bobo was of a very elastic temperament.  The pot
of coffee quickly completed his restoration.
"Say," he said, "I feel all right now.  I've got a clean
shirt.  It's not too late to go to Mrs. Cleaver's."
</p>

<p>
"Well!" said Jack.  "I was thinking you'd had
enough company for to-night."
</p>

<p>
"She'll be sore if we don't come," said Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't mind.  Put on your things, and I'll
telephone for the car to be sent back."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cleaver had a modest little house in the
Murray Hill district.  When Jack learned more about such
things he appreciated her astuteness in thus setting up
her banner in the stronghold of yesterday's aristocracy.
The great people of day before yesterday still linger
north of Washington Square, but they hardly count
nowadays.  A house on Murray Hill though still gives
its owner a cachet of exclusiveness that the grandest
mansion uptown may lack.
</p>

<p>
The modest aspect of Mrs. Cleaver's house was
limited to the Park avenue façade.  "My little house,"
she always called it.  But once inside one was
astonished by the great sweep of salon, hall, music room.
Below there was a billiard room; above, a library and
a little salon.  Strangers wondered where the inmates
lived.
</p>

<p>
Jack and Bobo were not too late, for other cars
were still rolling up to the door.
</p>

<p>
"None sweller than this outfit," Bobo remarked with
satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
They trod a red carpet under a peppermint striped
awning.
</p>

<p>
"Lord!  What'll we do when we get inside?" whispered
Bobo in a sudden panic.
</p>

<p>
"Just drift on the current," said Jack.  "I expect
things will be made easy for us."
</p>

<p>
And they were.  On the entrance floor there were
cloak rooms as efficiently run as those in a hotel&mdash;indeed,
the house was in all ways like a hotel.  They
presently found themselves mounting the main stairway
without having made a break.  The whole floor
above was thrown into one room, and as they mounted
a roar of polite conversation met them like an
advancing wave.
</p>

<p>
A superb major-domo at the head of the stairs threw
terror into Bobo's soul by demanding his name.  Bobo
stared at him dumbly, but Jack caught on and answered
for both.  Their names were bellowed to the roof.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Norman!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Robinson!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cleaver having allowed it to become known
that the amazing young millionaire of a day, New
York's latest sensation, might be expected, the sound
of his name had an electrical effect.  The conversational
surf was stilled as if by magic, and every face
was turned towards the two young men.
</p>

<p>
Bobo suddenly discovering that "society" people,
of whom he had stood secretly in awe, were no harder
to impress than those of the hotel, soared like a
balloon.  He advanced with languid eyebrows, lacking
only the monocle to give a perfect imitation of his
hero, the imported actor.  Jack followed at his heels,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cleaver, leaving the greatest persons there,
came swimming to meet them.  Figuratively they
rubbed their eyes at the sight of her.  She was one
who went in frankly for hothouse effects.  Her hair
was the color of cherrywood stain, her cheeks tinted
to match.  Her dress was one of those outlandish
creations one occasionally sees in the shop-windows, just
for an advertisement, one supposes.
</p>

<p>
"A beaded bib and a torn piano cover!" Jack described
it to himself.
</p>

<p>
Jack naturally had to content himself with the briefest
of nods from their hostess.  Her heavy ammunition
was reserved for Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"How good of you to come!  I hardly dared hope&mdash;on
such short notice!  I hope I am the first to present
you to the great world.  Everybody is here to-night.
But I'm not going to introduce you to a soul
until I've had you to myself for awhile!" etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
Pausing only long enough to unload Jack on a neglected
female sitting in the corner, she carried Bobo
off.  She was still gushing like the great geyser, and
Bobo had nothing to do but fiddle in his waistcoat
pockets, and incline a languid, attentive head, a part
he played to perfection.  Jack had no anxiety on his
account.  Whatever breaks he made, they would
simply call him an "original."  Was he not a hundred
times a millionaire?
</p>

<p>
Jack discovered that his companion like many a
neglected female was not without spice.
</p>

<p>
"A queer gang, isn't it?" was her opening remark.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Jack, "haven't had a chance
to give 'em the once over yet."
</p>

<p>
"You don't look as if you belonged," she said with
a sharp look.  "You look almost human."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're too discerning.  How did you get here
yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not human.  A girl of my attractions can't
afford it.  I'm Sonia Kharkov."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't have thought it of you."
</p>

<p>
"Everything's Russian nowadays.  I write poems
about surgical operations.  My last was entitled
'Appendectomy.'"
</p>

<p>
"How thrilling!  Sorry I never read any."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't publish.  I only talk about them.  It
gets me many a good meal."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you're a good sport," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
More than an hour passed before Jack caught sight
of Bobo again.  In the meantime he was parted from
the poetess, and the deafening clamor began to weary
him.
</p>

<p>
"There's enough hot air let out here to fill one of
the Consolidated gas-tanks," he had said to the poetess.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but it's not illuminating gas," she had retorted.
</p>

<p>
He reflected that he would most likely run across
Bobo in the vicinity of the refreshments, and conducting
an investigation, he discovered an excellent buffet
supper set forth in one of the rooms below.  Sure
enough, Bobo presently drifted in here.
</p>

<p>
"Where have you been?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mrs. Cleaver took me up to the library where
she receives a few of the principal guests," he drawled.
</p>

<p>
"My word!" said Jack, fixing him with an imaginary
monocle.
</p>

<p>
The sarcasm was lost on Bobo.  He exhibited a new
preoccupation.  He had a faraway gaze, and ever and
anon he heaved a sigh.  Even his appetite was affected.
He ate nothing at all; not a thing except a couple of
<i>vol au vents</i> of chicken livers, a helping of lobster
Newburgh, a handful of sandwiches, a cup of punch
or two, and a plate of <i>petits fours</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Come away," he said with his mouth full.  "I want
to talk to you."
</p>

<p>
They found an unoccupied corner under the stairs,
and lit cigarettes.
</p>

<p>
"I'm in love!" announced Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"No!" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"'S a fact!  The real thing!  Bowled me right
over!  Floored me!  I feel&mdash;I feel all gone here!"  He
laid a plump hand on the pit of his stomach.
</p>

<p>
"You need nourishment," said Jack.  "Come on back!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't josh me!  This is serious.  I'm completely
changed.  I feel as if I never wanted to eat again.
Her name is Miriam Culbreth."
</p>

<p>
"Um-yummie," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"She's the most beautiful girl in the whole world.
The moment I laid eyes on her I knew it was all
up with me.  No other girl ever made me feel like that.
And the wonderful part of it is she took to me right
off the bat."
</p>

<p>
"Hm!" said Jack cynically.
</p>

<p>
Bobo never heeded.  "We started right in
talking as if we had known each other for years.  We
found out that we both like the same things.  I never
met a girl that understood me so well.  She said she
admired me."
</p>

<p>
"Discriminating," murmured Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Such eyes!" sighed Bobo.  "When she looks at
you like this, through her lashes, you feel&mdash;you feel
as if you were going up in an airplane.  And she has
the nature of a child!"
</p>

<p>
"What are your intentions towards this sweet child?"
</p>

<p>
"Intentions!  No man could have any but the most
honorable intentions towards her!"
</p>

<p>
"Sure!  Then how are you going to support her
in the style to which she has been accustomed?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she's well fixed.  You should see the way she
dresses!"
</p>

<p>
"Be careful!  The best dressers are poor girls.  It's
a life and death matter with them.  This girl is
displaying her goods on the basis of a hundred million.
You can't honestly accept it for less."
</p>

<p>
"There isn't a mercenary thought in her head.  If
she ever marries it will be for love alone.  She told
me so herself.  You don't understand her.  She's as
simple and natural as&mdash;as a wild-flower!"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't noticed many wild-flowers around here."
</p>

<p>
"She isn't like these people.  She's different from
other girls."
</p>

<p>
"Did she tell you that, too?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes, how did you know?"
</p>

<p>
"They generally do."
</p>

<p>
"You must come and meet her.  I told her about you."
</p>

<p>
"What!" asked Jack sharply.
</p>

<p>
"I mean, I told her I had had the luck to secure
a secretary, who was a very clever fellow, and could
do everything for me."
</p>

<p>
"Now that was nice of you!"
</p>

<p>
"Come on up to the library and I'll introduce you."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not one of the distinguished guests."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right.  Mrs. Cleaver said I was to treat
the house as if it was my own!"
</p>

<p>
Bobo paused only long enough to snatch another
mouthful or two, and they made their way up two
flights of the broad stairs.  On the main floor the racket
was undiminished, though it was long past midnight.
Somewhere in the distance one seemed to be frantically
sawing on a violin, but it was impossible to be sure.
On the floor above the groups were smaller, and one
had a pleasant sense of rising above pandemonium.
</p>

<p>
Bobo led the way into the front room.  In the corner
a lovely lady reclined in a low basket chair filled with
cushions.  Three cavaliers were in attendance.  Quick
to spot the approach of newcomers, she dismissed the
three with charming insolence.
</p>

<p>
"Run along, boys.  I'm tired of you now."
</p>

<p>
The departing ones greeted the arrivals with no
friendly glances.
</p>

<p>
Jack could not but commend Bobo's taste in beauty.
The girl was indeed lovely to look at.  She had great
brown eyes, capable of working havoc in the most
indurated male heart, an exquisite naturally pale
complexion, and a glorious crown of chestnut hair.  She
was enveloped in slinky draperies of black silk, and
her ankles were truly poetic.
</p>

<p>
But when she began to talk, Jack did not feel obliged
to alter the opinion he had formed of her in advance.
There was nothing simple about her&mdash;or rather, her
simplicity was the effect of well-nigh perfect art.  Jack
was not much more experienced in these matters than
Bobo, but he had a healthy instinct of incredulity.
</p>

<p>
Her method with Jack was much more subtle than
with Bobo, and she had no objection whatever to
letting Jack see that it was.  It was part of her system
of delicate flattery to allow him to understand that
she recognized him at once as of a superior intelligence
to Bobo.  Jack was flattered of course, but she
made a mistake with him at the start that spoilt all
her work with him.  It never occurred to her that
Jack might be honest at heart.
</p>

<p>
No man, however safeguarded, could escape the
effect of her beauty.  For Jack there was but one
woman in the world, but even his breast was shaken
by a sudden lift of the brown eyes.  They had a
mysterious, haunting beauty, which even this bigness and
softness was not sufficient to explain.  Jack, when he
had an opportunity to look closer, saw that they were
not brown at all, but hazel; that is to say gray, with
a rim of brown around the iris.  It was the effect of
these strangely-colored eyes looking through curved
black lashes that moved men to reckless deeds.
</p>

<p>
Her conversation was not clever.  It had no need
to be.  If she had recited the Thirty-Nine Articles Bobo
would have hung on her lips entranced.  Jack was
too busy trying to explore the mystery of her real self
to pay much attention to what she chose to give out.
</p>

<p>
"Hazel eyes!" he was thinking.  "Where have I
heard of another girl with hazel eyes?  Oh, yes, it
was the pretty stenographer who tried to spy on Silas
Gyde.  She had chestnut hair, too, and a mole inside
her right forefinger.  I don't suppose these tapering
fingers ever jarred the keys."
</p>

<p>
"What are you thinking of, Mr. Robinson?" Miss
Culbreth asked in silvery tones.  "I declare you are
one of those dreadful men that bore you through and
through with their eyes and never say a word."
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather bore you with my eyes than with my
conversation."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy!  Clever, too!  I'm frightened to death
of you!"
</p>

<p>
"Didn't I tell you he was clever?" put in poor Bobo,
without at all appreciating what was going on.
</p>

<p>
"The worst of it is," said Miss Culbreth, "that
the men who won't talk are those who really have
something to say."
</p>

<p>
This was accompanied by the shadow of a disdainful
glance in Bobo's direction, and a warm flash
towards Jack, the suggestion being: "One has to humor
the stupid rich, but one enjoys oneself with the witty
poor!"
</p>

<p>
Jack was flattered through and through, but at the
same time he was thinking: "She's a regular man-eater.
I'll have to watch out for poor Bobo."
</p>

<p>
"You don't approve of me," she said, casting down
the lovely eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I do," Jack protested.  "What you mistake
for disapproval is quite another feeling."
</p>

<p>
"And what is that?"
</p>

<p>
"Instinct of self-preservation!"
</p>

<p>
"Are women so dangerous?"
</p>

<p>
"Not all women."
</p>

<p>
Her bold, pleased glance at Jack said: "We can
have fun right under his stupid nose, can't we?"
</p>

<p>
But Bobo was growing restless, and she turned to
him promptly, as befitted a prudent, marriageable girl.
"You were gone an awfully long time," she complained.
</p>

<p>
Bobo grinned like the Cheshire cat.  "Did you
miss me?"
</p>

<p>
She answered him with a long glance that visibly
made his head reel.  This was followed by a flash of
intelligence in Jack's direction, signifying: "This is
the sort of thing I'm obliged to hand out to them."
</p>

<p>
"Lord!  But she's a conscienceless lovely devil!"
thought Jack grimly.  "I'd like to teach her a lesson.
Anyhow, I'm hanged if I'm going to let her make me
a party to her game with Bobo."
</p>

<p>
So he made a careless excuse and left them.  Bobo
did not mind, of course, but an ugly shadow flitted
over Miss Culbreth's fair countenance.
</p>

<p>
Jack returned to the lower floor, where he could
smoke and watch the crowd undisturbed.  He had
not been there long before Bobo came downstairs
considerably agitated.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen her?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Who?"
</p>

<p>
"Miriam&mdash;Miss Culbreth," he said, blushing.  "We
started downstairs to the refreshment room together,
but I lost her somehow in the crowd.  Can't find her
anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"She will find herself when she wishes to, I expect,"
said Jack calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe she's gone on in," said Bobo hopefully.
He disappeared into the refreshment room.
</p>

<p>
As soon as he had gone a footman who had been
standing near approached Jack.  "Mr. Robinson?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
Jack nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Culbreth sent me for you, sir.  Will you
please come with me."
</p>

<p>
It was a point of pride with Jack never to be
surprised at anything.  With a nod, he followed the
man.  They avoided the stairs, and were raised to
the upper regions in a tiny elevator concealed behind
the wainscoting.  The young lady was found in still
another part of the house, a dainty silk-paneled room
at the back, and she was alone there with a tempting
supper&mdash;spread for two.  The footman evaporated.
</p>

<p>
"I was so hungry," she said, waving him to the seat
opposite, "and I couldn't face the crowd downstairs.
They paw one so!  So I had it brought up here, and
sent for you to keep me company."
</p>

<p>
"You make pretty free in the house," thought Jack.
</p>

<p>
"I live here," she said, as if she had read his thought.
"Mrs. Cleaver is my cousin.  Do you mind my sending
for you?" she said meltingly.
</p>

<p>
"Mind!" said Jack.  "I most certainly do!  I shall
return at once."  And he sat down.
</p>

<p>
She laughed.  "I like you, you're so unexpected.
A little while ago you piqued my curiosity so, I couldn't
rest without seeing you again."  This was said with
the wide-eyed seeming simplicity that was her trump
suit.  "You so plainly did not like me!  And most
people do!"  This with an adorable, deprecating shrug.
</p>

<p>
"I did like you!" Jack protested with an inscrutable
face.  "I liked you so much, I felt I had to be very,
very careful!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be careful!" she murmured, turning on the
full fire of those terrible eyes.  "I despise careful
men!"
</p>

<p>
Jack kept a prudent hold on himself.  "I have no
choice," he said calmly.  "How long would I hold my
job if I was not&mdash;well, careful?"
</p>

<p>
"You're afraid!" she said with provoking scorn.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"Is it true he has a hundred million?" she asked
idly.
</p>

<p>
"You can't prove it by me.  I'm only his secretary."
</p>

<p>
"But you do everything for him.  He depends on
you absolutely.  Anybody can see that."
</p>

<p>
Jack declined to be drawn into a discussion of Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"How long have you known him?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, quite a while," he said vaguely.  He could
not tell what mythical details of their past Bobo might
have given her.
</p>

<p>
"What a responsibility it will be on you!  Looking
after all that money and everything."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the executor and the lawyer will take care of
all that."
</p>

<p>
"Who is his lawyer?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>What does she want to know that for?</i>" thought
Jack.  She had overdone the carelessness with which
she asked it.  He gave her a fictitious name, and looked
at her with a new interest.  At the moment her
profile was turned towards him, and the way the light
fell on it certain lines of weariness were shown up.
She looked older than she had seemed at first.
</p>

<p>
Jack thought: "Mr. Gyde said that, too, of the
stenographer who worked for him.  This is more than
a coincidence.  Wouldn't it be amazing if&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of me?" she asked with a
direct challenge.  "I can see that you're revolving me
in your head all the time."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you do make a man dizzy," he parried.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm serious.  How would you describe me if
you had to?"
</p>

<p>
"Honest, I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Come now, you're a great reader of character.
You're always studying people, and trying to figure
them out to yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Am I?" said Jack.  He had a sudden idea.  "They
say there's more character in people's hands than in
anything else," he said carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Read mine," she said, extending a white and
tapering member.  It was the left hand she offered.
</p>

<p>
"It must always be the right hand."
</p>

<p>
She gave it him.
</p>

<p>
"I'll read character until the cows come home if
you'll let me hold it."
</p>

<p>
"Go on.  And no nonsense."
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever operated a typewriter?" he asked
slyly.
</p>

<p>
"No.  Why do you ask?" she asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing.  This hand looks to be capable of
anything."
</p>

<p>
"But my character?"
</p>

<p>
"Ambitious, luxury-loving and cruel," he began
mockingly.
</p>

<p>
She snatched the hand away.  "Horrible!  You're
no character-reader!"
</p>

<p>
But he had had time to see what he was looking
for: on the inside of the index finger was a large pale
mole, as big as the button on a woman's glove.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Though it was near morning when they turned
in, Jack was astir early, eager to begin the real
work on his case.  His surprising identification of
Miriam as the former spy on Silas Gyde whetted his
zeal.  Her present game of course was to secure the
supposed millionaire in the bonds of matrimony.  Was
the Red Gang behind that, or was it a private venture?
Jack was inclined to think it was all part of the same
scheme.  In either case Mrs. Cleaver, notwithstanding
her social position, must be Miriam's confederate.  It
was Mrs. Cleaver who had picked them up.  This put
the game on a pretty high level.  Almost every hour of
the past two days had made Jack's problem more
complicated&mdash;but also more fascinating.
</p>

<p>
When he was dressed, Jack mercilessly awoke the
luxurious Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lord!" groaned the plump youth.  "Do I have
to get up?"
</p>

<p>
"You can sleep all day if you like.  But we have
to have a little talk before I go out.  Sit up and rub
the sleep out of your eyes and pay attention."
</p>

<p>
Bobo obeyed, groaning lugubriously.
</p>

<p>
"It's about Miss Miriam Culbreth."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?" said Bobo, suddenly wide awake.
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember all you told me about her last
night?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do."
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't it seem a little foolish to you this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"No, it doesn't!  She's the most beautiful girl in
the world.  I love her more than ever!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm sorry.  I didn't take you very seriously
last night.  I thought it was too sudden.  You've got
to cut her out."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Bobo blankly.
</p>

<p>
Jack deliberated before answering.  He decided
against telling Bobo the whole truth.  It was within
the bounds of possibility that the infatuated youth
might tell the girl.
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell you all my reasons now," he said.  "But
believe me they are good reasons.  It has to do with
the game we are playing."
</p>

<p>
"You're not fair to her!" Bobo burst out.  "You
don't like her.  She told me so herself."
</p>

<p>
"You're right, I don't like her.  I have mighty good
reasons for it."
</p>

<p>
"She's the noblest woman on God's footstool!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to argue that with you," said Jack
dryly.  "I am speaking for your own good.  When
you first told me about her, I was afraid the poor
girl might be taken in, thinking you were a millionaire.
But I'm not worrying about her now.  She's able to
look after number one.  But I tell you if you do not
put her out of your head now, before the matter goes
any further, you'll regret it till you die.  I can't put
it any stronger than that, can I?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't give her up!  I <i>can't</i>!  I love her!" cried
Bobo, flinging himself down among the pillows.
</p>

<p>
"Take my word for it," said Jack earnestly, "she's
no good!"
</p>

<p>
"You're wrong!  You're wrong!"
</p>

<p>
Jack began to lose patience.  "Well, if you won't
listen to reason you'll have to take an order.
Remember our agreement.  You've got to give her up.
This is an order, now."
</p>

<p>
"I can't!  I can't!" moaned Bobo.
</p>

<p>
As usual in the display of Bobo's emotions, there
was something both ludicrous and pathetic in the sight
of the fat tousled head threshing the pillows.  Jack
grinned and said:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go to sleep again.  When you get up, have
a bang-up breakfast and you'll feel better.  I'll look
in on you at lunch time."
</p>

<p>
Jack's first visit upon setting out from the hotel
was to the offices of the Eureka Protective Association,
at the address on Forty-Second street given on
their representative's card.
</p>

<p>
He found the Association installed in an ordinary
suite, neither grandly nor shabbily furnished, but
entirely businesslike.  The customary staff of a small
office was visible at work: bookkeeper, stenographer
and office-boy.  In fact to the eye it was a wholly
conventional establishment; open, aboveboard and
prosperous.
</p>

<p>
Upon asking for the manager Jack was shown to
an inner room, where a man of about thirty-five with
a mop of lank, blonde hair hanging on his forehead,
and what is known as an open countenance, was seated
at a desk trimming his nails in unashamed idleness.
It appeared that this was Mr. Anderson.
</p>

<p>
"Dave Anderson at your service," said he
good-naturedly.  "What can I do for you?
</p>

<p>
"My name is Robinson," said Jack, "secretary to
Mr. Norman."
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere became balmier, as always with
the mention of that magic name.  "Sit down, Mr. Robinson."
</p>

<p>
Jack obeyed.  "Mr. Norman felt that he wanted to
know a little more about your association, and sent
me around to ask a few questions."
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly natural!" cried Mr. Anderson.  "Fire
away!  We court the fullest investigation.  Certain
parts of our business, of course, have to be conducted
in secrecy, but as to our responsibility and
trustworthiness, go as far as you like."
</p>

<p>
Jack asked all the natural questions, and Mr. Anderson
answered them with every appearance of frankness.
The information he gave merely amplified the
talk of his representative the day before; the great
public service Eureka performed, etc., etc.  Jack
learned nothing really significant from his talk, nor
had he expected to.  He asked no searching questions,
because he did not want Anderson to guess that his
customer was suspicious.
</p>

<p>
Jack's real purpose was to learn what kind of man
was at the head of this branch of the Red Gang's
activities, and while Anderson talked he studied him.
In the end he had to confess himself baffled.  Anderson
was anything but what he had expected to find.  He
seemed like one of those rather slack individuals who
represent the average of mankind; neither good nor
bad; neither wise nor foolish; an untidy, well-meaning,
loose-tongued fellow.  How such a one could be trusted
to direct an important part of so dangerous an enterprise,
Jack was unable to understand&mdash;unless it were
that Anderson himself did not know what was behind
the scheme.  But that did not seem credible either.
</p>

<p>
Jack left him, professing to be entirely satisfied on
his employer's account.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Delamare's promised letter of introduction to
the third Deputy Commissioner had come in the morning's
mail.  Jack's next visit was to police headquarters
to present it.  He wished to establish a connection
there on which he could fall back on in case of need.
</p>

<p>
He found the deputy an accommodating and capable
official.  Since he bears no part in Jack's story, it is
unnecessary to characterize him further.  Jack had
no intention of taking him into his confidence just yet.
He merely said that he was undertaking a little
detective work for his employer, and the Deputy furnished
him with a circular letter to all members of the force,
instructing them to lend the bearer any assistance that
he required.  Here, as elsewhere, the wonder-working
name of Norman smoothed Jack's way.
</p>

<p>
While he was there, Jack inquired as to the status
of the investigation into Silas Gyde's murder.  He
found that it was at a standstill.  The assassin, Jansen,
was confined in an asylum a raving maniac, and
nothing of importance had been unearthed concerning his
antecedents.  If he had been a member of any
anarchistic circle the fact had not been established.  He
appeared to have led a solitary life, moving from one
hall bedroom to another.  His mind had been gradually
undermined by too close an application to his
anarchistic studies, and to a book on the subject that
he was writing.
</p>

<p>
The fact of the book was new to Jack.  "Have
you the manuscript?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It was found in his room," the Deputy said.
</p>

<p>
"May I see it?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  But you'll find neither head nor tail
to it."
</p>

<p>
It was brought, and Jack was obliged to confess
the justice of the Deputy's description.  It was the
product of an insane brain.  One could not read more
than a line or two before the head began to whirl.  But
Jack discovered a clew in the manuscript which had
apparently escaped the police.  He did not call the
attention of the Deputy to it, but made a mental note for
his own use.  On the first page under the many and
fantastic titles of the proposed work was a dedication
in two words:
</p>

<p class="t3">
"<i>To Barbarossa</i>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Jack walked uptown turning over the word "Barbarossa"
in his mind.  Where had he heard it before?
Was it the name of a famous historical character or
an ocean liner?  The sign of a branch of the Public
Library gave him an idea.  He went in and consulted
an encyclopedia.
</p>

<p>
This told him two things; firstly, that Barbarossa
meant Redbeard, and secondly, that the original
Barbarossa was a Turkish sea rover.  As he was unable
to figure out any connection between the old
freebooter and a modern anarchist, he deduced that the
old nickname had been re-applied to some new
wearer of a red beard.
</p>

<p>
At the library desk he inquired: "Is there any writer
on anarchistic subjects who signs himself Barbarossa?"
</p>

<p>
"We have very little of that sort of matter," the
lady librarian assured him frigidly.  "There is no
such name in our catalogue of authors."
</p>

<p>
"Is there a bookstore where they make a specialty
of such writings?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
The librarian admitted with strong distaste that
there was, and gave him the address.
</p>

<p>
It was a little basement shop far on the East side.
It was presided over by a lanky-haired, spectacled
youth, who sneered at Jack's good clothes, and was
prepared to hate him on the spot.
</p>

<p>
"Have you anything by Barbarossa?" Jack asked
at a venture.
</p>

<p>
"Barbarossa's never written any books that I know
of," was the surly reply.
</p>

<p>
Jack thought with satisfaction: "Then there is a
Barbarossa!"  Aloud he said: "I mean anything he's
written."
</p>

<p>
The youth looked at him suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"I heard him speak," said Jack glibly.  "I'm crazy
to learn more about his ideas."
</p>

<p>
"Barbarossa writes for the <i>Future Age</i> magazine,"
said the snaky-haired one.  "He's one of the editors.
How is it you don't know that if you know him?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know him," said Jack.  "I only heard him
speak.  Have you got a copy of the <i>Future Age</i>?"
</p>

<p>
The young book-seller produced it.  "There's his
article this month," he said, pointing to a title in the
contents.  The author's name given opposite was Arno
Sturani.
</p>

<p>
"Is that Barbarossa's real name?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Everybody knows that!" was the scornful reply.
</p>

<p>
Jack bought the magazine, as well as other anarchistic
publications that caught his eye.  He told himself it
would be a good idea to study up their lingo a little,
against a future need.
</p>

<p>
At a corner drug-store in the neighborhood he
purchased a sheet of cheap note-paper and an envelope,
and on the counter laboriously composed the following
note:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Mr. Arno Sturani:</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Dear Sir:</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I read some of your articles In the "Future Age."  I
think they are great, but don't understand them very
good.  I am only a poor boy without much education.
But I like to think about things.  I want to force the
capitalists to give us a square deal.  I want to learn
more about your ideas.  Will you let me come to see
you?  Or tell me where you are going to speak next
time.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  <i>Yours respectfully,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Cassels.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The druggist gave his permission for Jack to receive
an answer at his store, so he gave that as his address.
He sent the letter in the care of the <i>Future Age</i>
magazine.
</p>

<p>
"There's one line started," he said to himself, as
he let it fall in the box.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

</h3>

<p>
Another thing that Jack had in mind was the
necessity of disguising himself.  Being an entire
stranger to the art of make-up, he required instruction.
Ralph, their private bell-boy at the Madagascar, had
seemed the likeliest person to apply to in such a case.
Leaving the hotel that morning, Jack had said to him
carelessly:
</p>

<p>
"I'm invited to a masquerade.  Where's the best
place to go for an outfit?  I want something better than
the ordinary costumer."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you try Harmon Evers?" was the reply.
"All the theatrical people go to him.  He's the greatest
make-up artist in New York."
</p>

<p>
"Where's his place?"
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-ninth street, just east of the Avenue."
</p>

<p>
Jack now bent his steps in that direction.  He
discovered a neat little shop on the street level with a
sign reading:
</p>

<p class="t3">
HARMON EVERS, WIGS AND THEATRICAL MAKEUP.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In each of the two paneled show-windows one
marvelous wig was displayed on its stand, nothing else.
The interior was discreetly curtained from view.
Opening the door, the pungent odor of grease paints greeted
Jack's nostrils.  Inside was as neat as out.  There was
a showcase setting forth cosmetics, and a counter
beyond with another wig or two on stands.  Back of the
counter were tiers of drawers neatly labeled.  The wall
outside the counter was filled by a collection of small
engravings of historical personages with especial
regard to their hirsute appendages.  Away back in the
shop were several curtained alcoves for trying on.
</p>

<p>
Behind the counter sat a little, dumpy old lady
befrilled and befrizzed, who suggested an erstwhile
favorite of the boards now retired.  Her large, faded
eyes fell on Jack with a startled look, which however
instantly disappeared in the polite saleswoman, as she
inquired what he wished.
</p>

<p>
It appeared that Mr. Evers was engaged with a
customer.
</p>

<p>
This customer presently issued from one of the
alcoves, a dandy of the old school who was obviously
much beholden to the wig-maker's art.  Evers
followed at his heels, rubbing his hands, and proudly
surveying his work.  Jack had the impression of a
stout, rubicund little man of middle-age, clean-shaven
and bald as an egg.  True to the custom of tradesmen
generally, he neglected his trade in his own person.
</p>

<p>
He was talking volubly as he came: "A very interesting
question, sir, the relation of brains to hair.
It is popularly supposed that a bald head is the result
of great mental activity, but I have not found it so in
my practice.  Among ordinary men it is about six
of one and half a dozen of the other.  But I believe
that a man cannot rise to real heights of greatness
without a good head of hair.  Yes, I know, there was
Julius Caesar, and I admit it would be difficult to prove
my case by historical examples, because wigs have
always been procurable, and fashionable portrait painters
naturally do not call attention to them.  But it is
an interesting speculation.  Good morning, sir."
</p>

<p>
Jack asked to speak to Mr. Evers in private, and
was shown into one of the alcoves.  It was like a
theatrical dressing-room, with a mirror surrounded by
electric lights, and a shelf beneath.
</p>

<p>
Jack did not offer to tell who he was, and the little
wig-maker, who seemed the soul of discretion, betrayed
no curiosity on the subject.  Jack came to the point at
once.
</p>

<p>
"Circumstances make it necessary for me to do a
little private detective work, and I'm obliged to learn
how to disguise myself, well enough I mean, so I can
go about the streets without danger of recognition.
Can it be done?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said Mr. Evers.  "It is done oftener
than you suppose."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of disguise do you recommend?"
</p>

<p>
"Let me think," said Mr. Evers, putting a
thoughtful finger to his chin.
</p>

<p>
Jack was sitting facing the mirror, while Evers
stood behind him studying his reflection through half
closed eyes.  Meanwhile Jack took stock of him.  In
repose the garrulous little man's face showed
unexpected lines of resolution.  He had a strong eye.  That
kind of eye may be found in wig-maker or bank president,
but whatever the trade of the possessor may be,
it is a pretty safe guess that he is master of it.  All
the visible part of Evers' skin, neck, face, skull, was
of a curious angry pink shade&mdash;but not unhealthy.  He
had but a fringe of gray hair around the base of his
skull, and his eyebrows were scanty.  Certainly, in
extolling the superiority of hairy men he had been
disinterested.
</p>

<p>
"It is a good mask," he said&mdash;meaning Jack's face.
"Good bones, well placed.  A promising foundation
for me to work on.  You are young, too.  No tell-tale
lines for me to erase.  Your hair is too luxuriant, but
I don't suppose you want me to cut it."
</p>

<p>
"What would be the gain if it altered my usual appearance?"
</p>

<p>
"True, true!  We'll get around that somehow.
Difficulties only add zest to the artist's work."
</p>

<p>
After studying a little longer he said: "Since your
purpose is to escape observation, I would suggest making
you as insignificant as possible.  Say a business man
in a small way; industrious but not very bright; of very
ordinary taste both in ideas and dress."
</p>

<p>
"My idea exactly!" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"But I must impress upon you that my work here
with false hair and pigments is only the beginning.  To
be successful our character must be constructed from
the inside out.  Before you leave here I will write
out a description of the character as I see it, which I
will ask you to study at your leisure.  I particularly
recommend that you repeat it to yourself just before
falling asleep at night.  It is the surest way of
impressing it on your subconsciousness."
</p>

<p>
"Fine!" said Jack, more and more taken with the
philosophic wig-maker.
</p>

<p>
Evers began to lay out the implements of his trade.
While he worked he talked uninterruptedly.
</p>

<p>
"I assure you one's subconsciousness is all-important.
Most people, unknown to themselves, play an
assumed part throughout their lives, a part that has
been suggested to the subconsciousness in early life
by something they admire in other people or in books.
When some great disturbance brings the real self to
light people are amazed at what they discover in
themselves.&mdash;Remove your coat, waistcoat and collar,
please."
</p>

<p>
"Make it simple, please," said Jack.  "Something
that I can put off and on myself at need."
</p>

<p>
"The best art is always simple," said Mr. Evers.
"First a wash for the entire face and neck.  It is very
thin and contains no grease to betray you in the
sunlight.  Its purpose is merely to dim the youthful glow
of health that distinguishes you.  See!  You look
fifteen years older already!  A slightly darker tone under
the eyes gives you a sedentary, slightly bilious look.
Next heavy eyebrows, which with round spectacles
will give you an owlish expression.  Also a stiff,
closely cropped mustache.  You put on eyebrows and
mustache with loose hair and glue which I will
furnish you.  Comb them out and clip them to the
desired length after they are stuck on.  The ready-made
articles never look natural.  You may depend upon
the glue.  It is my own invention.  No amount of
heat nor perspiration, nor soap and water can
affect it, but it melts at a touch of alcohol.  Lastly,
pomade your hair liberally, and slick it down hard.
See, it makes your hair look thin, and alters the whole
shape of your head.  There you are!"
</p>

<p>
"Wonderful!" said Jack, gazing at his strangely
altered aspect.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we've only just begun!" said Mr. Evers.
"Next comes the question of clothes.  Its importance
cannot be exaggerated.  Taste in clothes is of slow
growth.  The clothes of a youth tell you nothing, but
a mature man's attire betrays him unerringly.  Let me
see!  This requires study.  We shall probably not hit
it exactly at the first trial.  I should say first a derby
hat of very conservative shape, slightly old-fashioned,
and a suit stiffly cut, of good material but ugly pattern
of cloth.  Shirt and necktie are very significant.  They
should be of common design and coloring, such as
might be picked up at a sale.  I have all such things
here.  The suit may not fit you perfectly, but it will
take you as far as a clothing store where you can buy
another."
</p>

<p>
In due course Jack was ready to brave the sunshine
in his new guise.  The charge was steep, but he could
not deny that the work was worth it.  He left his
other clothes with Mr. Evers since he would have to
return to the shop to change.  The wig-maker stood
off and examined him with satisfaction.  Mrs. Evers
was called on to admire her husband's work.
</p>

<p>
"What name would you suggest for my new character?"
asked Jack, smiling.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Evers took the matter with entire seriousness.
"Let me see&mdash;you look to me as if your name might
be&mdash;&mdash;"  His face cleared&mdash;"I have it!  Your name
is certainly Mr. Pitman."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Pitman it shall be!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Fred Pitman," added Evers.
</p>

<p>
As Jack left the shop it was a few minutes before
twelve, that is to say, just about the time he had
designed to try out his new character for the first.  He
made his way up to Forty-Second street, and took up
his station before the building that housed the offices
of the Eureka Protective Association.
</p>

<p>
Here he walked slowly up and down well lost in
the crowd hurrying east and west.  He found his disguise
effective in that the passers-by no longer noticed
him.  Only when people stopped looking at him did
Jack become aware that in his proper person he
attracted friendly glances wherever he went.  That
started a curious speculation in his mind: "How do
people know whether they want to look at you or
not, if they don't look at you first to see what you are
like?"
</p>

<p>
It was half-past twelve before the man he was
waiting for appeared.  Mr. Dave Anderson turned east
on Forty-Second street at a brisk pace.  The
pseudo-Pitman followed close at his heels.  The chase led
across Fifth and Madison and in front of the Grand
Central station.  Jack began to fear that Anderson
lived in the neighborhood, and was bound home.
</p>

<p>
But at a modest saloon on Lexington avenue, a
place with a long-established air, he turned in.  After
loitering a moment or two outside Jack followed.
Behind the saloon was a small glass-roofed "garden"
set with tables.  The settled familiar style of the
waiters and diners suggested that this was a real
eating-place.  Jack commended Mr. Anderson's discrimination.
</p>

<p>
The tables accommodated four or six, and none was
entirely vacant.  It was therefore perfectly natural for
Jack to seek one of the chairs at the table occupied by
Anderson and another man.  They made him welcome.
Anderson scarcely looked at Jack.
</p>

<p>
The bill-of-fare provided Jack with an opening.
"Are you a regular here?" he asked Anderson.
"What's good?"
</p>

<p>
"To-day, the pot roast with noodles," was the
prompt reply.
</p>

<p>
It came and it was good.  Jack's hearty commendation
of the dish led naturally to a further exchange
of amenities.  When one of any two people has a
positive disposition to make friends, the task is
usually not difficult.  Mr. Anderson discovered in this
chance acquaintance a man after his own heart, who
thought the same as he on all important matters.  They
were soon talking like old cronies.  They finished
eating simultaneously, and left the place together.
Anderson, who was of an expansive nature, had already
mentioned that he ran a detective agency.
</p>

<p>
"You don't say!" said Mr. Pitman with an air of
strong interest not unmixed with envy.  "Well, say,
that's more fun than pounding the pavements
collecting overdue bills like I do."
</p>

<p>
"You must come around to my office some time, and
let me show you a thing or two," said Mr. Anderson
affably.
</p>

<p>
Jack was careful to accept the invitation as casually
as it was given.  "I sure will some time," he said.
</p>

<p>
They parted.
</p>

<p>
Jack went his way thinking with satisfaction:
"There's my second line started, all right."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pitman's business was now done for the day,
and Jack thought it was high time Mr. Robinson
re-embodied himself to look after his employer.  But
before he changed back he had a strong desire to test
his disguise on some one who knew him better than
Anderson.  He thought of Kate.  By this time she
must be in the thick of her preparations to open her
house.
</p>

<p>
To think of it was to turn his steps in that direction.
In ten minutes he was at the foot of the steps.
Sure enough the house was already transformed;
wooden shutters taken down, doors and windows flung
open, and a small army of workmen and cleaners
visible inside.
</p>

<p>
"Verily, Kate is a wonder!" he said to himself.
</p>

<p>
Mounting the steps, he rang the bell with twinkling
eyes.  Kate herself answered the door.  Jack, seeing
her come through the dark hall, experienced a rush
of delight.  With her capable, businesslike air she
was more adorable than ever.  Jack longed to fling his
arms around her to see how the business woman would
take it&mdash;but fortunately restrained himself from an
act so rash.  She fronted him with a polite, inquiring
look.  It gives one a queer turn to meet that look
on a familiar face.
</p>

<p>
"Is this Miss Storer?" he asked as polite as herself,
though he was bubbling inside.
</p>

<p>
Kate had stoutly denied the necessity of her taking
an assumed name.
</p>

<p>
She bowed.
</p>

<p>
"I understand you are fitting out this house to rent
furnished apartments."
</p>

<p>
She seemed slightly surprised.  "Yes.  But may I
ask how you learned of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a friend told me."
</p>

<p>
"What kind of accommodations do you require?"
</p>

<p>
Jack was hard put to it to keep from laughing in
her face.  Up till now he had been standing in the
vestibule with the light behind him.  But as Kate stood
aside from the door, he stepped in and turned around,
so thus his make-up was put to a full test.
</p>

<p>
"A room in the back," he, said, "away from the
noises of the street.  And not too high up.  The
second story rear would suit me very well."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," she said soberly, "that room is already
taken."
</p>

<p>
Jack could contain himself no longer.  There was
no one near.  He took off his glasses and smiled his
own smile.  "Don't you know me?" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
Kate gasped and fell back a step.  "Oh!  I wasn't
expecting you so soon!"
</p>

<p>
Jack chuckled.
</p>

<p>
A charwoman with bucket and brush came through
the hall, and they were obliged to pull themselves
together quickly.
</p>

<p>
"The gentleman who said he wanted that room may
not come back," said Kate.  "I'll show it to you
anyway."
</p>

<p>
She led him upstairs.  She had not yet touched Silas
Gyde's room, and as they went in she was obliged to
close the door after them to keep the people in the
house from seeing the strange conglomeration inside.
</p>

<p>
Jack seized her hand.  "Katy, darling, you take
my breath away, you're so wonderful!" he said,
trying to draw her towards him.
</p>

<p>
She would have none of that.  "Behave yourself!"
she said crushingly.  "You know very well why I had
to close the door!  How can I go on with this if you're
going to act in such a way!  Please remember who
you're supposed to be!  Do you suppose I'm going to
be familiar with my lodgers!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I forgot everything except how sweet you are!"
groaned Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Look in the glass!" she said.  "Do you suppose
I want that yellow face near mine?"
</p>

<p>
He frowned and rubbed his chin ruefully, not quite
knowing how to take this left-handed compliment.
"But&mdash;but I shan't be able to see you for ages, except
as Pitman," he complained.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I shall survive it," she said briskly.
</p>

<p>
"Aw, Katy!"
</p>

<p>
She changed the subject in her own prompt way.
"It's really a wonderful disguise!" she said.  "How
ever did you do it?"
</p>

<p>
He told her of his experience with Evers.
</p>

<p>
"And you," he said, "you haven't let any grass
grow under your feet.  You can open up to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Hardly that.  My greatest problem is this room.
How can I let the cleaners in here?"
</p>

<p>
"You and I had better do this," said Jack, careful
not to betray any pleasure in the prospect.
</p>

<p>
"How can you find time?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll send Bobo to a musical comedy to-night, and
slip in through the vault.  That is if you'll be here
to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I've already fitted up a room for Mother and I.
We'll be here."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said Jack.  The prospect of a stolen
interview with the demure Kate was unspeakably
delightful.
</p>

<p>
He told her something of his adventures the night
before.
</p>

<p>
"What a fool you have on your hands!" said Kate
scornfully.  "You'd better hurry back and see what
he's up to now."
</p>

<p>
"But I've heaps more to tell you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm busy.  So are you.  Tell me to-night.  What
will the servants say if we stay in here with the door
closed?  Run along!"
</p>

<p>
And she fairly shooed him out of the house.
</p>

<p>
Jack hastened down to Evers' shop, washed his face,
changed his clothes, and returned to the Madagascar.
Evers provided him with everything necessary to
re-assume the personality of Mr. Pitman when the time
came.
</p>

<p>
Bobo was out.  Jack applied to Ralph for information
as to his movements.  That preturnaturally
knowing youth was bursting with it.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, I seen him go out.  'Bout an hour ago.
Young lady come for him."
</p>

<p>
In spite of himself Jack was betrayed into a startled
exclamation.
</p>

<p>
Thus encouraged, Ralph went on with gusto.  "She
called him up this morning&mdash;that is I guess it was
the same one.  I was in the room brushin' his clo'es,
and I answered the 'phone.  I hears a voice like butter
creams: 'Is this Mr. Norman?'  Umm!  But when
she found it was me the cream froze."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Norman goes to the 'phone, and say, you
could see by the smile that tickled his ears that she
was feedin' him the Martha Washingtons then.
'Aw'fly good of you to call me up,' says he.  'No, I
don't think it was improper at all.'  Then she must
have ast him to lunch, for he said 'Sure!' in a voice
that near cracked the transmitter, and bounced up and
down like a kid when it sees its bottle.
</p>

<p>
"But then he remembered somepin and his joy was
turned to grief.  'Oh, I forgot, I can't come,' he says.
I heard her voice squeakin' over the wire: 'Why?'  He
says: 'I got a date with my secretary: very important
business.'  After that she did most of the talkin'.  He
only said: 'I can't!  I can't!  Say, I'm sorry!'  And
so on.  Say, he stuck to it, too, and at last she hung
up.  Say, he was almost cryin' when he come away.
He throws himself down on the bed and never says
a word to me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what then?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"About half an hour after I was down in the office
when I hear a young lady in a Kolinsky cape ask at
the desk for Mr. Norman.  A looker?&mdash;say, boss,
some scenery!  I was sent up with her card.  On the
back she had written:
</p>

<p>
"I have come for you."
</p>

<p>
"Did he go?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Did he go?  Does a chicken run when it hears the
corn fall in the yard!"
</p>

<p>
"Hm!  What name was on the card?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Miriam Culbreth."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
In the end Jack had to give up the idea of separating
Bobo from the lovely Miriam.  For one thing Jack
needed Miriam and Mrs. Cleaver in his present
business, and Bobo supplied his only excuse for going
there.  The ladies were not interested in the humble
secretary for himself.
</p>

<p>
So he warned Bobo afresh, and prayed that the
infatuated youth might not be led into any irrevocable
step before he was able to tell him the whole truth
about his inamorata.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile one of those tremendous intimacies
characteristic of the fluff of society sprang up between the
four.  Within a few days Bobo and Jack were all but
living at Mrs. Cleaver's house.  A hundredfold
millionaire gets on fast socially.  Jack was always
included in Bobo's invitations as an understood thing.
One witty lady was heard to call him the sugar that
coated the pill.
</p>

<p>
Jack speculated endlessly on the real nature of the
relations between Clara Cleaver and Miriam.  It was
given out that they were cousins, and on the surface
they exhibited a formal affection towards each other.
But that they did not love each other was very clear.
Dislike the same as murder will out.  Off her guard
Mrs. Cleaver's manner towards Miriam was as to
something she was obliged to put up with, and the
younger woman in her more natural moments displayed
more than a touch of arrogance towards her supposed
hostess.  Moreover, Mrs. Cleaver was clearly
well-born and Miriam just as clearly was not.  Not for a
moment did Jack believe in the supposed blood relationship.
</p>

<p>
Jack liked Mrs. Cleaver a lot better than Miriam.
The former might be light-headed, vain, luxury-loving,
rather silly, but she had a kind heart.  Jack could not
conceive of her as being engaged in calculated
villainy.  Yet she must be in the game, too.  She and
Miriam worked together.  The farther he explored
this amazing game the greater became Jack's
perplexity.  The different elements were so incongruous.
</p>

<p>
"But if I go deep enough I <i>must</i> find the link that
connects them all!" he told himself.  "The decent
little gentleman with the imperial; Barbarossa, the
anarchist; Dave Anderson, the detective; Clara Cleaver,
the well-born lady, and Miriam Culbreth, the adventuress!"
</p>

<p>
The relation between Jack and Miriam was a
complicated one.  As in the beginning, she made it clear
that while she intended to marry the millionaire she
was not averse to having the secretary make love to
her.  Jack's indifference piqued the spoiled beauty
almost beyond bearing.  She longed to bring him to her
feet, and she hated him cordially, too, as he learned
before he had been visiting Mrs. Cleaver's house many
days.
</p>

<p>
It was the tea hour.  Jack had come after Bobo,
but found everybody out.  They had left word for
him to wait, so he drifted up to the library where
they usually had tea, and picking up a book he dropped
into a chair to read.  At his left hand hung a portière
dividing the library from the central hall, which ran
up through the house.
</p>

<p>
After a little while Miriam and Bobo came up in
the elevator.  Evidently there had been a
misunderstanding about Jack's arrival&mdash;possibly some other
servant had admitted them, for Miriam said:
</p>

<p>
"We'll wait a while for him before we ring for tea."
</p>

<p>
They dropped into a cozy corner in the hall, a nook
favored of couples.  It was immediately on the other
side of the curtain at Jack's hand and he could
therefore hear every word spoken above a whisper.  He was
debating with himself whether or not the circumstances
justified him in playing the eavesdropper, when he
heard Miriam say:
</p>

<p>
"You've never told me how you and Jack met,
and how you came to choose him for your secretary."
</p>

<p>
That decided Jack.  He gave no sign of his presence.
</p>

<p>
Bobo replied: "Oh, I've known him a good while.
When I worked in the sash factory down-town, he was
there, too."
</p>

<p>
"What did you do there?"
</p>

<p>
"Bookkeeper."
</p>

<p>
"What did Jack do?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh he&mdash;he was a bookkeeper, too.  There were
two of us.  And we were friends outside the office,
too.  Used to go round together nights.  So when I
came into my money&mdash;why it was natural for me to
get Jack to help me to look after it."
</p>

<p>
"Not bad for Bobo," thought Jack.  He pricked up
his ears at the next words.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how you put up with him!" said Miriam.
</p>

<p>
"Put up with him!" echoed Bobo.  In his fancy
Jack could see the blank look that overspread the
honest fat face.  "Why&mdash;why, what's the matter with
Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"The way he runs you, I mean.  One would think
he was the millionaire, and you the hired secretary."
</p>

<p>
Bobo made queer, scared noises in his throat.  It
seemed to Jack that Miriam must suspect that she had
hit the nail on the head, but apparently she did not,
for her next words were in the same drawling,
careless tone.
</p>

<p>
"He all but tells you how to answer when people
speak to you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Bobo, somewhat relieved.  "But Jack's
clever, and I'm not."
</p>

<p>
"You're not as stupid as he likes to make out,"
suggested Miriam.
</p>

<p>
"Devil!" thought Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Make out!" said Bobo.  "Jack doesn't make out
anything.  He's my friend."
</p>

<p>
"My poor Bobo!" she said with indulgent tenderness.
"You're criminally good-natured!  Of course he
knows which side his bread is buttered on.  He's not
going to say anything openly.  But <i>friends</i>!  Oh, how
blind you are!"
</p>

<p>
"Jack and I are friends," repeated Bobo.  "Jack's
on the square!"
</p>

<p>
She laughed delicately.  Jack guessed that she patted
Bobo's hand or something like that.  "Oh, well, let's
change the subject," she said in a tone that forced him
to continue it.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Bobo, just as she had intended him to.
"Tell me what you mean.  Does he talk about me?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it isn't what he <i>says</i>," she said with seeming
reluctance.  "But it makes me mad!  Always poking
fun at you!"
</p>

<p>
"Liar!" thought Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Making fun of me!" said Bobo in hurt tones.  "Behind
my back!  I didn't think it of him!"
</p>

<p>
"There, forget it," she said soothingly.  "It doesn't
make any difference to your real friends."
</p>

<p>
"What did he say about me?"
</p>

<p>
"I shan't tell you.  I don't want to make trouble."
</p>

<p>
Jack grimly smiled to himself.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't see why you put up with it," she
presently went on.  "As it is, you daren't call your soul
your own.  He manages you like a child&mdash;you a grown
man."
</p>

<p>
"What can I do?" said poor Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Fire him!"
</p>

<p>
"So that's your game!" thought Jack.  "It's
foredoomed to failure, lady!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can't do that!" said Bobo horrified.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  I guess you can manage your own
affairs as well as other men, can't you?  Get a lawyer
to help you.  Everybody would think more of you if
you came right out and put Jack in his place.  They
talk about it, you know.  It's unmanly to submit to
the dictation of one who is really no more than your
servant.  Send him away, and see how much better
you'll get along with people.  He fixes it so that you
always show to a disadvantage beside him.  That hurts
me, because I know what there is in you!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you siren!" thought Jack.  In a way, he could
not but admire her cleverness.
</p>

<p>
She went on: "Some day I suppose you'll want to
marry."  Jack could imagine how modestly she cast
down the long lashes when she said this.  "I say this
for your own good.  No woman, you know, would
want to put herself in the position of being under the
thumb of her husband's secretary."
</p>

<p>
All Bobo could find to say was: "I'm sorry you don't
like him."  Jack had to confess to himself that a better
man than Bobo might well have been stumped by such
a situation.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it doesn't matter about me," she said, "but he
is openly rude to me.  You don't seem to care."
</p>

<p>
"I do!  I do!" cried poor Bobo.  "I'll put a stop
to that.  I'll speak to him!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said with a kind of plaintive spitefulness,
"tell him I told you, and then he'll act worse to me
than ever.  If you cared about me at all, you wouldn't
keep him for another day."
</p>

<p>
"You just leave it to me, I'll fix it," said Bobo
desperately.
</p>

<p>
"That's what you say every day, but I don't see any
change."
</p>

<p>
"So this is an everyday affair!" thought Jack.  "Poor
Bobo!"
</p>

<p>
"It can't go on," she said gloomily.  "I think too
much of you as a friend to stand seeing another man
run you.  I'd rather give you up&mdash;as a friend.  If I've
got to put up with Jack Robinson, I don't want to see
you any more."
</p>

<p>
The softest creature, pushed to the wall, shows fight.
"I won't fire Jack," said Bobo sullenly.  "You're just
trying to run me the same way you say he is.  If I've
got to go, I'll go!"
</p>

<p>
"Good for Bobo!" thought Jack.
</p>

<p>
She quickly performed the undignified maneuver
known as climbing down.  "No, Bobo," she said meltingly.
"You are right.  I shouldn't have spoken that
way.  It is none of my business.  But I can't bear to
see you imposed on.  It made me forget myself!"
</p>

<p>
"I can take care of myself," muttered Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me," she said angelically, "and let's change
the subject.  Come into the library, and I'll order tea."
</p>

<p>
It was Jack's turn to be surprised.  He judged from
her voice that she had already risen, so he had about
two seconds to make up his mind how to act.  He
relaxed completely in the big chair, let his head fall
back, closed his eyes and breathed deeply.
</p>

<p>
She came between the curtains.  He heard the swish
of her silk petticoat.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she said sharply.  Surprise, fear, chagrin, all
were blended in the sound.
</p>

<p>
Bobo at her heels said blankly: "I'll be jiggered!"
</p>

<p>
Jack opened his eyes sleepily, blinked at the sight
of them, and sprang up.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter!" he said.  "Where am I?  Oh&mdash;I
must have fallen asleep.  Please excuse me!"
</p>

<p>
He flattered himself it was very well done.  Bobo
at least was completely taken in.  As to the girl, he
could not be sure.  It was likely that being an accomplished
dissimulator herself, she would on principle suspect
him of dissimulation.
</p>

<p>
But she gave away nothing in her face.  "You're
excusable," she said with a light laugh.  "They told
us you hadn't come.  If you could have seen how funny
you looked!  Come on, let's have tea."
</p>

<p>
Throughout that ceremony Jack labored with his
most light-hearted air to remove any suspicions she
might have that he had overheard her talk with Bobo.
It was not easy to read that young lady's face, but he
believed that he saw her gradually relax and be at ease
again.
</p>

<p>
The sequel to this scene took place later the same
night.  Jack, Bobo and Miriam went to the theater,
and afterwards to the Alpine Heights to sup.  Having
arrived at the exquisite restaurant, Miriam announced
that she had lost a pearl pin in the theater.  Poor
Bobo had to go back after it, though he had already
ordered a <i>recherché</i> little supper.  Jack offered to go,
but Miriam silenced him with a peculiar look, so he
sat back and let things take their course.
</p>

<p>
When they were alone together, Miriam softly said,
turning the hazel eyes full on him: "Why can't we be
friends, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
He could have sworn the lovely orbs were big with
tears, and in spite of himself his heart leaped; she
was so beautiful!  "Steady!" he whispered to himself.
"It's probably onions or pepper!"
</p>

<p>
"Aren't we friends?" he said with an air of surprise.
</p>

<p>
She sadly shook her head.  "You know we're not!
You distrust me, dislike me; you cannot hide it!"
</p>

<p>
"It's not so!" said Jack.  "I've already explained
what it is that you think is dislike.  You put a man
on the defensive.  You've already gobbled up poor
Bobo, skin and bones and hymn-book, too!  I've got
to be careful!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you won't be serious!" she pouted.  "And you
saw how I lied to get the chance of speaking to you
alone."
</p>

<p>
"Then there wasn't any pearl pin?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not!"
</p>

<p>
"Poor Bobo!  I'll be serious.  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's nothing special!  I just wanted to see if
I couldn't bring about a better understanding between
you and me.  It's awfully hard on Bobo, who is such
friends with both of us&mdash;that you and I can't get on
better I mean."
</p>

<p>
"Let's have a better understanding!" said Jack heartily.
Privately he was thinking: "Lovely lady, what
are you driving at now?"
</p>

<p>
"Bobo is such a dear," she went on, "but he's
terribly dependent.  He depends on you, and now he's
beginning to depend on me!  Well, it seems to me that
we share a pretty serious responsibility, his having all
that money and all.  We ought to consult about what
we should do, and agree on a course of action.  If
you and I pull against each other, Bobo will be torn
in two, so to speak."
</p>

<p>
Jack looked seriously impressed, but inwardly he
was grinning wickedly.  "Ha!" he thought, "having
failed in her effort to kick me out she is now
proposing in diplomatic language that we get together and
whack up."  Aloud he said: "I expect you're right,
though I hadn't thought of it that way.  I thought
I would take care of Bobo's business affairs, and you
would look after his personal character."
</p>

<p>
"But under altered circumstances it might be difficult,"
she said darkly.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be dense.  I suppose you know that Bobo
wants to marry me."
</p>

<p>
Jack never batted an eye.  "I can't say that I am
exactly surprised.  Nor that I blame him," he added
gallantly.
</p>

<p>
"Be serious.  Of course I haven't accepted him yet.
I have to be sure of my own feelings."
</p>

<p>
Jack stroked his lip to hide a grim smile.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any objection to his marrying me?" she
asked boldly.
</p>

<p>
Jack lied quickly.  "None whatever."
</p>

<p>
"Then why did you try to poison his mind against me?"
</p>

<p>
Jack thought: "Oh, Bobo!  Bobo!  I'm glad I didn't
tell you all."  To her he said with seeming astonishment:
"I!  Poison his mind against you!  What an idea!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, try to dissuade him from&mdash;er&mdash;paying me
attention."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miriam, put yourself in my place for a
moment.  I am Bobo's friend.  I do feel the responsibility
of looking after him, just as you say.  He meets
a lovely girl of whom we know nothing, a girl lovely
enough to believe the worst of&mdash;and he falls head over
heels in love.  Was it not my plain duty to beg him
to go slow, to think what he was doing?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, believe the worst of?"
</p>

<p>
"Just a figure of speech.  You are really remarkably
beautiful.  It isn't reasonable to suppose that you
have reached your present age without having had&mdash;well,
exciting things happen to you."
</p>

<p>
She shrugged.  "I wish I had had."  She was unable
to keep a sharp note out of her voice.  "You told him
that I&mdash;wasn't all that I ought to be."
</p>

<p>
"I had to say something to make him pull up long
enough to give me time to find out."
</p>

<p>
"Then you haven't got anything against me?"
</p>

<p>
Jack's eyes were as limpid as a mountain stream.  If
one is going to lie, one may as well do it artistically.
"Nothing in the world, Miriam!"
</p>

<p>
She leaned across the table and gave his hand a
little squeeze.  "I'm so glad we've had this talk," she
murmured.
</p>

<p>
They beamed on each other in seeming friendly
fashion&mdash;but there were hard points of light in each pair
of eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Pleasant little comedy," thought Jack.  "I'm willing
to keep it up as long as she is."
</p>

<p>
"We must often consult together, and decide what
is best for Bobo," she went on sweetly.  "And if he
won't do things that you think he ought, I'll add my
influence.  And then I'll get you to help me with him
when I need you."
</p>

<p>
"Fine!" said Jack.  "Poor Bobo!" he silently added.
</p>

<p>
As was usual with this young lady, her romantic and
sentimental scenes generally led up to a very practical
climax.
</p>

<p>
"Has Bobo given you power of attorney?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Why is it he won't draw even the smallest of checks
unless you are there?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that was one of the things we agreed on when
I took the job of secretary.  He wanted to be saved
from throwing it about."
</p>

<p>
"Very wise," said Miriam.  "But now that he has
another disinterested friend the situation is altered,
isn't it?  If I am with him it will be sufficient.  I shall
tell him that you release him from that part of your
agreement."  This was said with a charming smile,
as a sort of experimental joke.
</p>

<p>
Jack smiled back no less sweetly.  "But I have not
released him."
</p>

<p>
"I thought we were going to work together," she
pouted.
</p>

<p>
Jack still affected to treat the matter as a joke.  "You
surely don't expect me to yield up the only source of
my power!&mdash;the hand upon the purse strings!"
</p>

<p>
She shook an arch finger at him&mdash;but there was an
angry spark in the hazel eyes.  "Beware!" she said
merrily.  "The power of the faithful secretary is
threatened by the adored wife.  You'd better accept
my offer of an alliance when it is open."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, when Bobo takes a wife I'll resign," said Jack,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
Bobo came bustling back at this juncture.  "I've had
a deuce of a time," he grumbled.  "The theater was
closed.  I found the watchman, but he wouldn't let me
in.  Said he'd find the pin if it was there, and turn it
into the box-office.  Old fool!"
</p>

<p>
"It was cruel of me to send you all that way," cooed
Miriam.  "Sit down and eat a good supper.  I shan't
be able to eat a mouthful till you say you forgive me!"
</p>

<p>
"Forgive you!" cried poor Bobo.  "I'd go to China
and back if it would please you!"
</p>

<p>
They gazed into each other's eyes, while Jack grimly
sipped his wine.  "You're clever," he was thinking,
"but there's a serious defect in your method.  How do
you expect me to fall for you, when you let me see
you making such a fool of Bobo!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Meanwhile Jack was not neglecting his other
"lines."  In the character of Mr. Pitman he
lunched with Dave Anderson nearly every day, and the
intimacy between them ripened fast.  After several
invitations, Mr. Pitman finally allowed himself to be
persuaded to visit Mr. Anderson's office.
</p>

<p>
They sat in the inner office with their cigars, and
discussed crime in all its aspects.
</p>

<p>
"Anything&mdash;er&mdash;specially interesting on just now?"
asked Mr. Pitman, with a look suggesting that he
was not averse to hearing the most horrible details.
Jack, under Evers' tuition had developed the character
of Pitman to a high degree of artistry.
</p>

<p>
"No.  The fact is I don't go after ordinary business
any more; don't have to.  I only have one case, so
to speak, and that keeps me on Easy street.  All I
have to do is sit here and take the money.
</p>

<p>
"What a cinch!  What kind of case is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Did you notice the name on the door?"
</p>

<p>
"Eureka Protective Association.  Whom do you protect?"
</p>

<p>
"Millionaires!"
</p>

<p>
Thereupon Jack had to submit to hearing again what
a fine concern Eureka was, what a benefit it conferred
on the public, etc., etc.  Though Anderson was at his
ease with his friend, he told it all as seriously as
before; there was no suggestion of a tongue in his
cheek.  Jack listened with well-assumed interest, hoping
to get some real light on the subject later.
</p>

<p>
"How did you get into it in the first place?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Dumb luck!" said Anderson.  "I'll tell you all
about it some day."
</p>

<p>
Jack, fearful of spoiling everything by a display of
eagerness, let the matter drop for the present.  Fate
presently rewarded his discretion.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't a thing to do this afternoon," said Anderson.
"And you said you weren't busy.  Let's go out
and have a drink."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pitman did not refuse, of course.  They went
and had their drink, and had another, and in the
course of the afternoon Anderson's tongue was
gradually unloosed, and the whole story came out.
</p>

<p>
"It was three years ago it started.  I was doing a
general detective business, and just barely making out,
week by week.  It was the time that big millionaire
Ames Benton was killed by anarchists; remember?"
</p>

<p>
Jack nodded.  He had a feeling that the loose ends
of his case were now beginning to draw together.
</p>

<p>
"One day an oldish gentleman called at my office,"
Anderson went on, "a decent, respectable body, that
you would expect to see coming out of church on
Sunday morning.  His hair was fixed in an old-fashioned
way, sort of brushed forward of his ears like, and
he wore a heavy mustache and neat little goatee or
imperial."
</p>

<p>
Jack had the pleasant feeling that he was getting
"warm" as children say in their game.  They were
sitting in an alcove of a saloon under the elevated
railway, and he was glad of the semi-gloom of the place
that prevented Anderson from seeing his face too
clearly.
</p>

<p>
"He didn't give me his name," Anderson went on,
"in fact I don't know it to this day.  I just call him
'Mr. B.'  He told me right off the bat that he was
an anarchist, and I was a bit startled, noticing the
little black satchel he carried.  I remarked that he
didn't gee with my idea of a Red, and he explained
that he was disguised.  So I don't even know what he
looks like naturally."
</p>

<p>
"He went on to tell me that he had experienced
what he called a change of heart&mdash;sort o' got
religion you understand.  The murder of Mr. Benton
had sickened him, he said, and now he was anxious to
do something to make up for the harm he had caused."
</p>

<p>
"He let on that he was one of the leading Reds of
the country, a kid of supreme grand master with the
entrée to every lodge.  He said he wasn't going to
betray any of his comrades, but that with my help, if I
was willing, he would draw their teeth, so to speak,
by giving warning to their intended victims.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I wasn't in a philanthropic mood myself,
being as I had so much trouble already to make ends
meet, and I didn't want to invite trouble with the
Reds or anybody else, so at first I was cool to his
scheme.  But as he talked on I began to wake up to
the possibilities.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, we began to dope out the scheme of
Eureka right then, or rather, he doped it out and I
listened with big ears.  He had it all thought out
before he came.  When he talked about getting all
the millionaires to subscribe for personal protection,
I saw a happy future opening up.  The best of it was,
it was absolutely bona fide, and on the level; we really
had something to sell them, for my friend, as I say,
had the entrée to every anarchistic circle in the country,
and was prepared to furnish me with full information
of any plot they laid against a rich man."
</p>

<p>
"The only thing we stuck on was the division of
the proceeds.  He demanded seventy-five per cent.  I
tried to laugh him down&mdash;but it didn't get across.  He
wasn't a man you could get gay with.  He had an eye
that fixed you like a brad-awl.
</p>

<p>
"'You forget,' he said, 'that I'm the one who supplies
the essential thing.  I could get any one of a
hundred detective agencies for the rest.'
</p>

<p>
"I tried to bluff him a bit.  'Not after you've opened
it to me,' I said.  'I could queer it!'
</p>

<p>
"'You won't do that,' he said very quiet.  And, by
Gad, when he fixed me with those eyes, I thought of a
dozen horrible deaths I might die, and I knew that I
couldn't split on him if I wanted to.  A wonderful
man.  In the end I had to accept his hard terms.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's all.  From the start it worked like
a charm.  With the horrible death of Ames Benton
fresh in their minds, the millionaires fell all over
themselves to subscribe for protection.  We started at a
moderate figure, and gradually jacked up their dues.
You'd open your eyes if I told you the amount of
money that passes through this little office every
month."
</p>

<p>
"Give me an idea," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"That's something I'll never tell any man," said
Anderson with a slightly drunken leer.
</p>

<p>
"Do you only operate in the city here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He may have other agencies outside.  He
may have other agencies right here in town for all
I know.  It was part of our agreement that I was to
approach nobody except the men whose names he
furnished.  I haven't all the millionaires on my books
by a long sight."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to tell me you've been in business with
this man for three years and don't even know his right
name?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a fact, and what's more I've never laid eyes
on him from that day to this."
</p>

<p>
"Come off!" said Jack incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"It's a fact, I tell you.  It stands to reason, don't it,
that he couldn't be seen around here?"
</p>

<p>
"You could meet him outside."
</p>

<p>
"Too risky.  If the other anarchists got on to his
connection with me, his life wouldn't be worth a
plugged nickel!"
</p>

<p>
"But you know where he lives?"
</p>

<p>
Anderson shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Then how do you send him his share of the proceeds?"
</p>

<p>
"I send it in cash on a certain day every week.  I
put it in an envelope together with a statement of the
week's business, and send it to a name and address
previously furnished me that day over the 'phone.
It's always different.  Generally to a hotel, to be
called for.  I send it by messenger."
</p>

<p>
"Have you never had the curiosity to follow up the
messenger?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir!  I've learned that it's healthier for me
to follow instructions.  I get my instructions over the
'phone, and by Gad! if they're not carried out to the
letter he knows it, and I soon know it from him!"
</p>

<p>
"He must be a wonderful man."
</p>

<p>
"He's a marvel!  Say it scares you like, the way he
knows things.  He tells me everything to do: who to
see and how to approach him; how to follow him up.
And everything always turns out just the way he says.
It's like magic!"
</p>

<p>
Anderson's talk got a little muzzy, and drifted
away to other subjects.  A perfunctory attention was
all he required and Jack's brain was free to ponder
on what he had heard.  He believed Anderson's story
in the main.  Incredible as it had seemed beforehand,
he no longer doubted that Anderson was an innocent
tool in the affair&mdash;at least comparatively innocent.
The great sums he was making had no doubt helped
to quiet an inquiring mind.  When one is anxious not
to discover an unpleasant fact, one may very easily
remain in ignorance of it through all.
</p>

<p>
It began to look as if the decent little gentleman
with the goatee was the guiding spirit in the whole
scheme.  Jack had made a long step forward in his
investigation, but he now found himself opposed by an
intelligence of the first class; one before whom Jack's
youth and inexperience might well falter a little.  He
marvelled at the cunning with which the principal used
innocent men to further his criminal projects.
Apparently he had built up a highly organized business
of blackmail, with various departments all working
independently of each other.  And he gathered up all
strings in his own hands.
</p>

</h3>

<p>
Arno Sturani, otherwise "Barbarossa," answered
Jack's note and invited him to call at his
house in the evening.
</p>

<p>
Jack visited Evers' shop as a preliminary, and he
was obliged to go in the afternoon before closing hours.
He dispatched Bobo to dine with Mrs. Cleaver and
Miriam.  While Bobo could hardly be said to be safe
in that company, still it was some satisfaction to Jack
to know where he was.
</p>

<p>
The astute little wig-maker and his wife, the retired
ballet-dancer, greeted Jack like an old and valued
customer.  Old-fashioned shop-keepers have this art.
</p>

<p>
"Everything going well?" asked Mr. Evers.
</p>

<p>
"Splendidly!"
</p>

<p>
"That little job I did for you; has it served its
turn?"
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't have been better."
</p>

<p>
"What do you require to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"A fresh make-up for another purpose."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Come back into one of the dressing-rooms."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Evers was distressed to learn that Jack had
put himself out to get to the shop before closing time.
</p>

<p>
"You can make an appointment by 'phone for any
hour of the day or night," he said.  "Of course it
would be too conspicuous for me to let you in and
out of the shop after closing hours, but my apartment
is upstairs.  Come there any time, and we can get
what we need out of the shop."
</p>

<p>
Jack thanked him.  "This time," he said, "I want
to look like a mere lad, a poor boy in cheap worn
clothes, but a student, a highbrow, full of wild,
anarchistic ideas."
</p>

<p>
"Anarchistic?" said Mr. Evers, elevating the scant
eyebrows.  "Are you going into that kind of society?"
</p>

<p>
"Temporarily."
</p>

<p>
"Beware!  I know nothing about such people, but I
am told they are like wild beasts.  Curious, isn't it,
how they run to hair?  Disturbs all my theories.  Such
beards!  Such tangled, flowing locks.  How is it that
men so unbalanced are thus favored?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Jack, smiling.  "Perhaps they
don't have any more than other men to start with,
but spare the scissors and the razor."
</p>

<p>
"I've taken that into account.  Even so, you never
heard of a bald anarchist, did you?"
</p>

<p>
Jack admitted that he had not.  "Perhaps I can
give you some first-hand information later," he added.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Evers said he would be glad of it.
</p>

<p>
"Now let me see as to your make-up," he went on.
"Your luxuriant hair will now come in handy.  Let it
fall over your eyes so.  A pair of thick glasses this
time to make you look short-sighted.  I have a pair
specially made with lenses of clear glass let in to
enable you to see where you are going.  Clothes are the
principal item.  I think I have just what you require."
</p>

<p>
"It's no trouble for me to make you look like a
youth who might frequent such company," he said, "but
the question is, can you keep up the character once
you get there?  I am told those people talk a strange
jargon of phrases that the uninitiated cannot understand."
</p>

<p>
"I've been boning up on their literature," said Jack.
"I think I can keep my end up."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I see I am not dealing with a tyro," said Mr. Evers
with a flattering air of respect.
</p>

<p>
Jack dined at an humble little restaurant on the East
Side, such as befitted his new condition, and afterwards
presented himself at the address on East Broadway
furnished by Sturani's letter.  It was one of those
plain old-fashioned dwellings common in the
neighborhood.  They are occupied by the elite of the East
Side; that is to say, doctors, lawyers, politicians, who
still find it profitable to live among their clients and
constituents.
</p>

<p>
Barbarossa's house was a combination of residence,
school and club.  On a brass plate beside the door
was the legend: "Sturani School of Social Science."  A
youth, much the same as the one who had sold him
books, let Jack in, and after favoring him with a hard
stare, led him to a small room at the back and told
him to wait.  The house seemed to be full of
Barbarossa's disciples.  Jack had glimpses of groups in
the unfurnished parlors, arguing with fury.
</p>

<p>
Jack had learned that Barbarossa's position among
anarchists corresponded in a way with the description
of himself which the mysterious Mr. B. had furnished
Anderson, and he naturally inferred that Barbarossa
might be another alias of Mr. B.'s.  His heart beat
fast with excitement as he waited for him, thinking
that he was perhaps about to come face to face with
his real adversary.
</p>

<p>
But when the redoubtable Barbarossa plunged into
the room, Jack was speedily disillusioned of his hopes.
Plunged is the only word to use: the anarchist's movements
were like those of a frolicking mastiff&mdash;only Barbarossa
always affected an air of weighty import.  He
was enormously fat, and it was genuine fat, as Jack
could tell by the shake and sag of him as he flung
himself into a chair.  By no stretch could he have
transformed himself into the neat, decent little gentleman
so often described to Jack.  This was not Mr. B.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, Barbarossa had a mass of red hair standing
on end around his head like a halo, and a spreading
red beard.  These were indubitably real, too, and had
obviously taken years to produce.
</p>

<p>
"You're Cassels," grunted Barbarossa.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  English!"
</p>

<p>
"English descent, sir."
</p>

<p>
"We don't get many English boys interested in
ideas."
</p>

<p>
Jack privately hoped this would not count against
him.  He had considered assuming a foreign character,
but had given it up as being too difficult to maintain.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want of me?" demanded Barbarossa.
</p>

<p>
"I want to learn," said Jack.  "I want to meet
men with ideas.  I want to take part in the movement."
</p>

<p>
"Have you any money?"
</p>

<p>
Jack was somewhat taken aback.  "A little.  I'm
only a working-boy."
</p>

<p>
"If you can pay, you can come to my school.  It's
fifteen dollars payable in advance.  Afternoon or
evening classes.  You can come as often as you want."
</p>

<p>
"I'll come," said Jack.  "I'll bring the money
to-morrow.  Is there some work I could do, too?  For
the Cause.  Can I belong to a circle?"
</p>

<p>
"Circle?" said Barbarossa with a sharp glance of
his little blue eyes&mdash;they were at once irascible and
short-sighted, eyes of a fanatic.  "What kind of a
circle?"
</p>

<p>
"Liberators."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you're talking about.  If there
is any such thing, I suppose you'll be invited to belong
when you've proved yourself worthy.  Come to my
school and I'll put some ideas into your head if it's
not too English."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir," said Jack rising.  This was as
far as he supposed he could get on the first meeting.
</p>

<p>
"By the way, who told you about me?" demanded
Barbarossa.
</p>

<p>
"I read your articles in the <i>Future Age</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, who told you about the <i>Future Age</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Jack was tempted to try an experiment.  "Fellow I
used to room with.  The hero who croaked old Silas
Gyde.  Emil Jansen."
</p>

<p>
It had an electrical effect.  Barbarossa was out of
his chair with a bound.  His ruddy cheeks turned a
gray color, on which the network of little dark veins
stood out startlingly.
</p>

<p>
"Silence!  Don't speak that name here!  Hero
nothing!  Madman!  Fool!  What have you got to do
with <i>him</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, nothing!" stammered Jack, affecting a great
confusion.  "Isn't he one of you?  Isn't he working
for the Cause?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know him!" cried Barbarossa.  "If he
claims to be my friend I repudiate him!  Such
madmen are like to ruin us all!"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;you said in your article that I read, that the
capitalistic order must be overthrown at any cost.
That he was a hero who gave up his life to
accomplish it."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right in a periodical," said Barbarossa.
"They don't care what you write.  But murder&mdash;&mdash;!"  The
fat man shuddered.  "I'm a responsible citizen.
I've got a wife and four children to think of."
</p>

<p>
Jack thought: "In anarchy, like other religions, there
seems to be a considerable gap between preaching and
practising."
</p>

<p>
"What did Jansen tell you about me?" demanded
Barbarossa.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing particular," said Jack.  "He just let on
that he admired you, and was trying to live according
to your teachings.  He read me some out of a book
he was writing.  He dedicated it to you."
</p>

<p>
"What!" cried Barbarossa.  "In writing?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was written down."
</p>

<p>
"And the police searched his room!  Oh, my God!
I'm done!"  He collapsed in his chair.
</p>

<p>
Jack looked at the collapsed mountain of flesh, and
suppressed a smile.  Not a very formidable object this.
</p>

<p>
"Was it my right name, Sturani?" Barbarossa asked
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"No.  He had written: 'To Barbarossa.'"
</p>

<p>
A little color returned to the big man's face.  "Oh,
well, the police are stupid.  Maybe they won't establish
the connection.  I expect I would have heard from
them before this if they had.  That's all, Cassels; you
can go."
</p>

<p>
"And may I come to the school to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, if you bring the money."
</p>

<p>
From a public booth, Jack telephoned Harmon
Evers that he would be right up to change back to his
proper person.
</p>

<p>
On the way uptown he sought to digest what he had
learned.
</p>

<p>
"Barbarossa is certainly not the man I'm looking
for.  Just the same, his fright makes it clear that he
is at the head of some group that Emil Jansen
belonged to.  I must join that group.  It's hardly
possible that Barbarossa himself instigated the attack on
Silas Gyde.  He's only a paper anarchist.  Somewhere
back of him I'll find the cagy little 'Mr. B.' again.
Lordy!  This case lengthens out like a telescope!"
</p>

<p>
"Well!" said Mr. Evers, "you're back early.  Did
you see any anarchists?  How about their hair?"
</p>

<p>
"The main guy of all had a bald spot as big as a
saucer.  Just a hedge of hair all around like the
burning bush in bloom."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm relieved to hear that."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Jack had not yet succeeded in establishing just
where Miriam and Mrs. Cleaver fitted into the
jig-saw puzzle he had to solve.  Miriam, from the
foreknowledge he had gained from Silas Gyde's letter,
he had no hesitating in dubbing an out-and-out bad one,
but he was less sure about Clara.  He set himself to
discover more about her.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing mysterious about her origin, and
he had no difficulty in learning the main facts about
her from outside sources.  She was a poor girl, the
daughter of a great physician who had lived beyond
his means.  She had married before her father's death,
the son of a wealthy and prominent family, but he,
having run through his fortune, shot himself.  She
had, therefore, been left penniless, nor had she, so far
as was known, received any legacy since his death.
</p>

<p>
To Jack, therefore, the grand question was, where
did she get the money that provided the Park Avenue
house, the bands of servants, the magnificent
entertainments; the dresses, jewels, furs and automobiles.
It was charitably said that she had made it in lucky
speculations, but Jack was not satisfied with that.  One
must have something to speculate with.  There had
never been any scandal in connection with her name.
</p>

<p>
These parties of Mrs. Cleaver's offered no lack of
food for speculation.  In her way Clara was quite the
rage, and every element of smart New York society was
represented among the guests&mdash;except perhaps the most
hide-bound exclusives.  She always took care to provide,
too, a leaven of clever artistic people, "to amuse
the rich," she said.
</p>

<p>
So far everything was usual and explainable, but
there was always another element present that mystified
Jack.  This consisted of various young people of
both sexes, always good-looking, perfectly dressed
and at least superficially well-bred; often vivacious and
charming&mdash;but invariably with hard, wary eyes.
</p>

<p>
These self-possessed youngsters turned up mysteriously,
and were as mysteriously lost sight of again.
They made a convenience of Mrs. Cleaver's house
almost as if it had been a hotel.  Mrs. Cleaver
introduced them effusively at her parties like dear friends,
but at other times she ignored them&mdash;and they as
frankly returned the compliment.  Sometimes they
made good independently of her and enjoyed a more
or less brief career in society.  Sometimes they
disappeared and were seen no more.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cleaver was not by any means a prudent, wary
woman, and it was not difficult for Jack to learn where
she banked.  She often took him about with her.  She
had four bank accounts.  Through the good offices
of Mr. Delamare Jack next learned from the books
of the banks concerned, that she had been in the habit
of depositing a thousand dollars weekly.  In other
words, every Friday afternoon she took a thousand
dollars downtown and added it to one of her four
accounts.
</p>

<p>
Having learned so much, the next time Friday came
around Jack took care to be on hand early at the
Cleaver house.  He kept his eyes open for all that
took place that morning.  Just before lunch a
messenger boy delivered a small packet for Mrs. Cleaver.
Jack by a casual question or two of a servant, learned
that this was a regular happening on Friday mornings,
and that the packet was always carried direct to
Mrs. Cleaver by her orders.
</p>

<p>
Jack, who had already learned from Anderson of
the large part played by the messenger service in
Mr. B.'s operations, guessed that this packet came direct
from him.  It was a good enough working theory anyway.
Fifty thousand a year was no mean price!  For
that, Jack figured, Mrs. Cleaver lent her name and
social position to the blackmailers, and allowed them
to use her house as a base of operations.  It was
likely he thought that she did not know what their
game was, and with that handsome sum coming in so
regularly, did not care to inquire.
</p>

<p>
Jack conceived the bold idea of enlightening
Mrs. Cleaver, trusting to her better qualities to turn her
against her present employer, and ally her with himself.
</p>

<p>
His opportunity to talk to her alone came that night,
when Miriam and Bobo failed to return for dinner.
Jack and Clara dined alone.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the meal she said listlessly: "Where
shall we go to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Let's not go anywhere for a change," said Jack.
"Let's have a fire in the library, and sit and talk."
</p>

<p>
That struck her as a pleasantly novel idea.  "All
right.  I'm sick of the game to-night.  And you're
a restful person."
</p>

<p>
Jack smiled a little grimly, thinking that what he
had to say to the lady would not exactly be restful.
</p>

<p>
When they were comfortably established before the
fire, he began to lead up to it gradually.
</p>

<p>
"This society game is a funny one, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, here you are spending your life rushing
around like a mad woman to teas and dinners and
dances, theaters, operas, fashionable shows of every
kind.  What do you get out of it, really?"
</p>

<p>
"God knows!" she said wearily.
</p>

<p>
"When you're not tearing around to other peoples'
shows you're having one of your own.  Lord! what a
gabbling mob!  To hear them, you'd think they loved
each other to death, and positively worshiped you.
And as a matter of fact nobody gives a single damn!"
</p>

<p>
"That's true."
</p>

<p>
"Then why do you do it?  It must cost a heap of
money."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she said slowly.  "Habit, I suppose.
In the beginning it seemed like the only thing
open to a woman like me, the only way to get on;
to build up a social position I mean, and so be powerful.
Now I have it, I find there's nothing in it."
</p>

<p>
"Then why don't you give it up."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him in a scared way.  "How could
I?  I'm in the thick of the game.  I've got to play it
out.  What else could I do?  Where could I go?"
</p>

<p>
"You have real friends, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"I had once.  But after the scramble of the last
three years&mdash;I don't know&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
The words "three years" struck Jack with
meaning.  That corresponded exactly with the period of
"Mr. B.'s" activities.
</p>

<p>
"Any one could begin a new life if they really
wished," he said.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him queerly.  "You're not leading
up to a proposal of marriage, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Jack, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"It sounded like it," she said, settling back.  "I like
you ever so much, but of course it wouldn't do."
</p>

<p>
"I have wondered why you never married again," he
said.  "So many men&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they don't mean anything.  It's just the
fashion to pay me attention.  They look on me more as
an institution than a woman.  The ones who do come
to the point of asking me are always horrid&mdash;or poor."
</p>

<p>
"But you have plenty."
</p>

<p>
"The appearances of wealth are illusory."
</p>

<p>
"I should think fifty thousand a year&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She laughed lightly.  "Where did you get that idea?
I haven't the half of it."
</p>

<p>
There was a silence while Jack debated how to go on.
</p>

<p>
"Clara, I would really like to be your friend," he
said at last.
</p>

<p>
"That's nice of you."
</p>

<p>
"If you only felt disposed to tell me frankly of your
situation and your difficulties, perhaps I could help
you."
</p>

<p>
Something in this alarmed her; she favored him
with a sharp little glance.  "Mercy!" she said, turning
it off with a laugh.  "I haven't any special difficulties
that I know of."
</p>

<p>
"Who are these mysterious hard-eyed young people
that come and go in this house as if they owned it?
I mean George Thatcher, Emily Coster, Grace Marsden,
and the others.  Miriam herself; who is she, and
where did she come from?  She's no cousin of yours."
</p>

<p>
Frank terror leaped out of Mrs. Cleaver's eyes.
She attempted to mask it with a semblance of anger.
"They are my friends!  Am I obliged to give you an
account of them!"
</p>

<p>
"Queer friends!" murmured Jack.  "You scarcely
speak to them unless there are outsiders here."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by taking this tone towards me!"
</p>

<p>
"I wish to be your friend.  Don't force me to believe
the worst of you.  If your conscience is clear, why
should you fear a few plain questions?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll hear what they are first.  I don't like your
tone."
</p>

<p>
"You receive a thousand dollars every week.
Where does it come from?"
</p>

<p>
A fresh terror shot out of her eyes, and again she
sought to hide it under a towering anger.  "What
impudent nonsense is this?"
</p>

<p>
Jack went on imperturbably: "It is brought to you
by a messenger in cash every Friday morning, and
every Friday afternoon you carry it to the bank."
</p>

<p>
"You have been spying on me!  And you talk about
being my friend?"
</p>

<p>
"I do wish to be your friend.  It is true I have
been spying on you, as you call it.  I was forced to
it by my duty to an older friend.  Are you going
to answer my question?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not!  What right have you to question
me about my private affairs!  A paid secretary!  This
is what I get for admitting you to my friendship!"
</p>

<p>
"To lose your temper and to insult me puts you
in the worst possible light, you know.  That is how
a guilty conscience always acts."
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing to me what you think of me.  You
can go."
</p>

<p>
"I am not going," Jack said quietly.  "You and
I have got to have this out."
</p>

<p>
She had now worked herself up to a fine pitch of
anger.  She laughed, but there was little amusement
in the sound.  "I've got to have it out with you, have
I?  With <i>you</i>!  Oh, this is rich!  This is the perfection
of impudence!  Will you go, or must I call a
servant to show you the door?"
</p>

<p>
She sprang up as she spoke, and her hand approached
the bell button.  Gone was her listlessness
now.
</p>

<p>
"You will not do that," said Jack quietly.
</p>

<p>
Her thumb rested on the button.  "Why won't I?"
she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Because you don't know yet how much I know."
</p>

<p>
Her hand dropped irresolutely.  "What is it to
me what you think you know.  Are you trying to
blackmail me?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not."
</p>

<p>
"What's your game then?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you if you don't have me put out," said
Jack, smiling dryly.
</p>

<p>
She agitatedly paced the room.
</p>

<p>
Jack went on: "I am doing you the credit of
supposing that you do not know the true source of the
money you spend."
</p>

<p>
"You are accusing me of dishonesty perhaps," she
said haughtily.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how honest you are," said Jack
simply.  "I am not acquainted with the terms of your
agreement with Mr. B."
</p>

<p>
She stopped as if she had been transfixed.  She went
white to the lips.  "Mr. B.!" she whispered.  "You
know him!"
</p>

<p>
"I know this much," said Jack slowly.  "The thousand
dollars a week which he sends you is the proceeds
of blackmail&mdash;and murder!"
</p>

<p>
She staggered.  He thought she was swooning, and
sprang to catch her.  But she fended him off, and
sank in a chair unaided.  It was a full minute before
she could speak.
</p>

<p>
"You are just trying&mdash;to frighten me," she
murmured huskily.
</p>

<p>
"I shall prove it before I go."
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;what do you want of me?"
</p>

<p>
"I expect when I prove to you the truth of what
I say, that you will repudiate Mr. B. and his
generous allowance, and help me to hang him."
</p>

<p>
She did not answer at once, but only stared at him
with big eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You will not accept anything further from him, of
course."
</p>

<p>
Still she did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"Will you knowingly help to levy blackmail, and to
bring about additional murders?"
</p>

<p>
She burst into tears.  "How do I know what to
do?" she wailed.  "You haven't proved what you say!
How do I know what your game is?  I have
nothing&mdash;not a sou!  Where am I to go!  How could I
live?"
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding her pretended astonishment,
indignation, dismay, Jack saw that she had always been
secretly conscious of living over a volcano.  She had
no doubt resolutely averted her face from it, but had
dwelt in daily expectation of this dreadful scene.
</p>

<p>
"As to the means of existence, you need not worry,"
said Jack.  "I shall take care of that."
</p>

<p>
"You?"
</p>

<p>
He saw that he had gone too far.  "I mean Bobo
of course.  It is his game I am playing."
</p>

<p>
"Who was murdered?" she asked abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"Silas Gyde for one; Ames Benton for another."
</p>

<p>
"Anarchists committed those crimes."
</p>

<p>
"Two poor mad youths were used to carry out the
purpose of a devilishly sane brain&mdash;our friend Mr. B. in
fact."
</p>

<p>
For the last time she attempted to bluff it out.  She
yawned elaborately, though the hand with which she
covered her pretty mouth still trembled.  "Mercy!  It
sounds like a melodrama!  You must excuse me if I
cannot swallow it entire.  I'm afraid you've been too
faithful a student of the movies."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I describe Mr. B. to you?" said Jack.  "His
favorite disguise I mean: he probably has many
disguises.  He is a smallish man but rather heavy; not
corpulent, but thick-set.  He is always well dressed in
a decent, sober style.  He has piercing blue eyes, and
wears a heavy gray mustache, and a little goatee or
imperial.  He has an old-fashioned look, due
principally to the way he wears his hair; that is brushed
forward of his ears in the manner popular fifty years
ago.  He has very courteous manners and is given to
rather bookish, literary turns of speech."
</p>

<p>
The remnants of Clara Cleaver's courage oozed
away.  She sagged down in her chair white and shaken.
"That is the man," she whispered.  "What are you
going to do with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Why does he send you all this money?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she meekly replied.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll give you my guess.  It is to secure your
house as a base for the young birds of prey that hunt
in society.  These are the spies that furnish him with
the information about rich people necessary to his
blackmailing business."
</p>

<p>
"It can't be as bad as all that!" she murmured with
weak horror.
</p>

<p>
"How else do you explain George Thatcher and
Grace Marsden&mdash;and Miriam."
</p>

<p>
"You are not sure of what you say."
</p>

<p>
"You know in your heart it is true.  As to Miriam,
I am sure.  Mr. Gyde left us a detailed account of
how she tried to spy on him, and a faithful description
of her.  Ever notice the mole on her right forefinger?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "Oh, there'll be a horrible
public scandal!" she wailed fretfully.  "I'll be
disgraced forever&mdash;though I have done nothing!"
</p>

<p>
"Except take his money," Jack put in dryly.
</p>

<p>
"How did I know?  Where am I to hide my head
now!  Oh, I wish I'd never laid eyes on you!"
</p>

<p>
Jack took a new tack.  "Well, I see I can expect no
help from you," he said, making as if to go.
</p>

<p>
"Wait!" she said quickly.  "Don't leave me!  I
shall go out of my mind if I'm left alone!  If I tell
you everything I know, will you promise to save me
from public disgrace?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll do my best."
</p>

<p>
"Sit down.  I'll have to go back to the beginning.
It's a long story."
</p>

<p>
"My father was a famous doctor here in New
York," Mrs. Cleaver began.  "He was what
you call a self-made man; he had risen from obscurity
and pulled my mother up with him.  I was their only
child.  When I was growing up my father was making
a princely income, and we lived like millionaires.
The best people in New York were among his patients,
and we went everywhere.
</p>

<p>
"I married at twenty&mdash;the usual fashionable marriage.
Mr. Cleaver was the last of a fine old family
of wealth and position, and I was considered to have
done well for myself.  But I loved him in a heedless,
unthinking sort of way.  He was young like myself,
and extremely good-looking.
</p>

<p>
"My first real experience of life came with the death
of my father, four years after my marriage.  It was
discovered that he had lived up to every cent of his
great income.  He left nothing but debts and an art
collection.  The proceeds of that went to purchase my
mother a modest annuity.  Even that was wasted, for
she lived less than a year after my father.
</p>

<p>
"That left me with no one in the world to turn to
but my husband.  The tragedy of self-made people is
that they have no lifelong friends.  My husband was
good to me in his way; we got along together well
enough, but in his disappointment and chagrin at the
disclosure of my father's affairs, I received my first
suspicion that all was not well with our own.
</p>

<p>
"But I closed my eyes to it, and we continued to
live as before, denying ourselves nothing.  It was the
only way I knew how to live.  We had our big houses
in town and in the country, a mob of servants,
automobiles, horses.  I knew nothing about business and my
husband never spoke of it.  One thing that helped to
ease my mind was the fact that we were never bothered
by creditors as I knew some of my friends were.  My
husband paid up everything on the nail.  It was a point
of pride with him.
</p>

<p>
"When he had spent his last dollar, literally his last,
he shot himself.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there I was.  Mr. Cleaver had no near relatives.
His cousins had always frowned on our extravagance,
and I could expect no aid from them.  As for my
so-called friends, at the first hint of disaster they began
to melt away.  I was so helpless I didn't even know
how to close up my great house.  I couldn't summon
resolution enough to discharge the servants.  I lived for
a while on the proceeds of my dresses and jewels.  It is
tragic how much such things cost, and how little they
bring!
</p>

<p>
"I was at the end of my rope, driven nearly frantic
by worry.  The unpaid servants were becoming
impudent, and that seemed like the last straw.  I have
always been so dependent on servants!  I was actually
considering taking my husband's way out&mdash;when this
man came to see me.
</p>

<p>
"He sent up no name.  But in the frightful state I
was in, one jumps at anything for a moment's distraction.
I had him brought up.  You have already described
him; his silvery hair, brushed in an odd way,
his sober, well-made clothes of no particular style.
His old-fashioned manner prevented me from placing
him socially; he might have been almost anybody.  The
piercing blue eyes were remarkable.  His was most
kind and courteous, fatherly one might say.
</p>

<p>
"Though it is three years ago, every detail of that
interview is still fresh in my mind.  He thanked me first
for my indulgence in consenting to receive him incognito.
I would agree, he said, when I had learned the
object of his visit, that it were better he should
remain unknown.  He asked me to think of him simply
as 'Mr. B.'
</p>

<p>
"He went on to say that through mutual friends he
had learned of my difficult situation, and had been
much moved thereby.  It was the hardest case he had
ever heard of, he said, and I had his sincerest sympathy.
I was too desperate in my mind to even pretend to be
indignant at the intrusion of a stranger into my affairs.
Indeed I found his sympathy comforting.  I hadn't
received much.  Most people had acted as if my
misfortunes were due to my own fault.  He soothed me
like a nice old uncle.
</p>

<p>
"He said he was a very rich man, so rich in fact,
that his money made him uneasy.  He didn't want to
die with it, he said, and he was looking around for some
honorable way of getting rid of it.  He used that very
word, 'honorable'; it made me smile.  He said it was
easier to make a fortune than to get rid of it.
</p>

<p>
"Fancy how my heart began to beat at this.  When
one is desperate one cannot be particular.  I could
scarcely believe my ears.  It seemed like the miracle I
had been hoping for&mdash;like an answer to my prayer.
He said that the more popular forms of philanthropy,
such as colleges, hospitals, libraries, etc., were
distasteful to him, as smacking too much of ostentation and
publicity.  He wanted to make his distribution in
secret.
</p>

<p>
"'Everybody looks after the poor,' he said, 'and
nobody thinks of the rich when they are overtaken by
misfortune.  They are the worthiest objects of help,
and I intend to devote myself to the relief of the
impoverished rich.  You are my first case.  Will a
thousand dollars a week be sufficient?'
</p>

<p>
"I thought I was dreaming.  I managed to stammer
out a question about what conditions were attached to
the loan or gift.
</p>

<p>
"'No conditions!  No conditions!' he said,&mdash;'that is
only one condition; that you will preserve absolute
secrecy concerning it.'
</p>

<p>
"I promised of course.  I scarcely knew what I was
saying.  I thought perhaps he was harmlessly insane.
I certainly never expected anything to come of it.  But
when he had gone I found on the table a little packet
containing a thousand dollars in bills.
</p>

<p>
"I still thought I had been visited by an amiable
lunatic.  I used the money to pay some of my most
pressing obligations.  I discharged the insolent
servants, and got others.  I didn't expect to hear from
him again.
</p>

<p>
"But one week from that day a messenger boy
brought me a packet containing a similar sum, and it
has been coming ever since with absolute regularity.
</p>

<p>
"I can see that you are incredulous about there having
been no conditions attached to the gift, but I have
stated just what happened.  I can see now that I was
a fool, but then it was easy for me to believe that I
had been relieved out of pure philanthropy.  As if
there was any such thing!
</p>

<p>
"At first the money came unaccompanied by any
communication, but later, when he knew, I suppose,
that I had become absolutely dependent on it, I began
to receive instructions.  In the beginning he still used
the language of philanthropy&mdash;he wanted to help this
young man or that young woman to gain a footing in
good society&mdash;but latterly, feeling more sure of me, I
suppose, he has become frankly peremptory.  Oh! if
I had only sent the money back in the first place!"
</p>

<p>
"What sort of instructions?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Principally for me to receive certain young people
that he would send me, and introduce them to society;
sometimes to introduce them to particular persons.
This seemed harmless enough.  People will do anything
to get into society, you know."
</p>

<p>
"But when you saw these young people didn't you
begin to be suspicious?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I didn't want to be suspicious!  Their manners
were good enough.  They didn't shame me.  And
nowadays society is such a go-as-you-please affair,
nobody held me responsible."
</p>

<p>
"What other kind of instructions did you get?"
</p>

<p>
"To ask certain people, generally some well-known
rich man, to my house.  The hardest thing I ever had
to do was to go to the Madagascar and scrape acquaintance
with Bobo in the corridor.  I nearly died at that,
but it was too late to turn back.  I was terrified by
the way the man always knew instantly when I had not
obeyed him."
</p>

<p>
"The spies he had in your house would keep him
informed," said Jack.  "How did you know that day
which of the two of us was Bobo?"
</p>

<p>
"He had described him to me."
</p>

<p>
"Does 'Mr. B.' still come here?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I have never seen him but the once.  He writes
to me, and very often he calls me up to learn if I have
anything to report.  I have no way of communicating
with him unless he calls up."
</p>

<p>
"Now about Miriam?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cleaver sat up, and her tired eyes sparkled
with hatred.  "That woman!" she cried.  "If you knew
what I have had to put up with from her!  I loathe her!
Oh, I would like to see her brought low.  What have
you got against her?  Tell me!"
</p>

<p>
Jack shook his head, smiling grimly.  "All in good
time," he said.  "You're telling me your story now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Miriam's just another of them.  She came the
day before I received my instructions to get hold of
Bobo.  I was ordered to take her into my house, and
give it out that she was a cousin.  That was the final
humiliation!"
</p>

<p>
"Is that all you can tell me about Miriam?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "We don't confide in each other," she
said with tight lips.
</p>

<p>
There was a considerable silence between the two
before the fire.
</p>

<p>
"What are you thinking about?" asked Mrs. Cleaver
nervously at last.
</p>

<p>
"Just trying to dope out a plan to get him&mdash;with your
help."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm afraid!" she wailed.  "When my income
is cut off what shall I do?"
</p>

<p>
"I promised you&mdash;in Bobo's name&mdash;to take care of
that."
</p>

<p>
"To the same amount?" she asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
Jack smiled dryly.  "I'm afraid I'd hardly feel
justified in recommending that Bobo keep up all
this&mdash;but, say, ten thousand a year."
</p>

<p>
"Ten thousand!" she cried, aghast.  "That's nothing!"
</p>

<p>
A grimmer tone crept into Jack's voice.  "Sorry, but
we don't owe you anything, you know.  If you refuse
to help me, I should have to have you arrested."
</p>

<p>
If she had defied him Jack's position would have
been a little awkward, for he was not prepared to go
as far as he had said.  But Mrs. Cleaver's spirit was
broken now.  She only shuddered and wept the louder.
</p>

<p>
"Ten thousand!" she wailed.  "I'll have to give up
everything that makes life worth living!"
</p>

<p>
"You told me you were sick of all this."
</p>

<p>
"I'll have to move into a miserable apartment!"
</p>

<p>
"Come now, plenty of people have a whale of a time
on ten thousand&mdash;or even the half of that."
</p>

<p>
"Suburbanites!" she said with the utmost scorn.
</p>

<p>
"Has 'Mr. B.' any regular time for calling up?"
asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"No.  Every few days.  I haven't heard in nearly
a week.  I shall probably hear to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Very good.  Now listen.  When he calls up, make
out you're in great anxiety.  But don't give him too
many details over the 'phone.  Suggest that it's not
safe to do so.  You can let him understand though
that it has something to do with Bobo or me.  Tell
him that you think I am having you watched.  Tell
him that you must see him in order to find out how
to act.  Don't ask him to come here; that would surely
excite his suspicions.  Name some public place; a hotel
would be the best."
</p>

<p>
"Will I have to face him?" she faltered.  "I'm afraid."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be there," said Jack.  "You may leave him to me."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

</h3>

<p>
Jack had no great confidence that Mrs. Cleaver
would stand by him unless he were right there to
assert his supremacy; she meant well, but she was as
weak as water.  Therefore he took care to be on hand
early at her house next morning, and was prepared to
hang around all day if necessary listening for the
telephone.
</p>

<p>
By great good luck the call came while he was in the
room with her, so that she had no opportunity to
betray him, even if she were disposed to do so.  By the
instant change in her when she heard the voice over the
wire, Jack knew that it was he whom they were expecting.
</p>

<p>
In dumb play Jack ordered her to hold the receiver
an inch from her ear.  Then by bringing his head close
to hers he was able to hear practically all the man
said.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning.  Is there anything you want to tell
me?"
</p>

<p>
Jack thrilled a little hearing the veritable voice of
his adversary.  It was the nearest he had yet come to
him.  A familiar quality in the sound tantalized him.
But he could not place it.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mrs. Cleaver.  Her breathlessness
seemed quite natural.  "I'm so glad you called up.  I
can't explain very well.  There's something queer.  I'm
afraid they may be listening at the switch down-stairs."
</p>

<p>
"Something in connection with our two young
gentlemen?" asked the voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, one of them is acting so strangely."
</p>

<p>
"The principal one?"
</p>

<p>
"No, the other.  He seems well&mdash;suspicious.  I
could explain better if I saw you.  Can I see you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, if you wish," came the calm reply.
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"Let me see&mdash;you'll have to come at once, because
I am leaving town this afternoon.  Suppose you come
to the Hotel Bienvenu, and meet me in the main lobby."
</p>

<p>
"Half an hour," Jack whispered to Mrs. Cleaver.
</p>

<p>
"I'll come just as soon as I can dress," she said over
the 'phone.  "Can you give me half an hour?"
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  I shall expect you in half an hour."
</p>

<p>
Jack's heart beat high with hope.  He immediately
called up police headquarters and got the Third Deputy
Commissioner on the wire.  After identifying himself
to that individual, he asked to have a plainclothes man
meet him in the bar of the Hotel Bienvenu in twenty
minutes time, to make an arrest.  The Deputy Commissioner
said he would bring the man up himself, so there
could be no possibility of missing Jack.
</p>

<p>
To Mrs. Cleaver Jack said: "I will go to the
Bienvenu now and wait for my men.  You leave here in
precisely twenty-five minutes.  Have your chauffeur
let you out at the side door of the Bienvenu, and
then walk around by the street to the front door.  This
will bring you past the windows of the bar, and will
give me a chance to point you out to my policeman.
Then I'll send him up into the lobby, and I can remain
in the background.  He will arrive in the lobby at the
same moment with you."
</p>

<p>
All the preliminaries passed off as Jack had planned.
The Deputy Commissioner and the plainclothes man
turned up in the bar of the Bienvenu at the very
moment of the time appointed.  They took up their post
at a window, and sure enough in five minutes
Mrs. Cleaver swam past their ken, regal and languid in her
silver fox furs.
</p>

<p>
"That's the woman," Jack said to the policeman.
"Mark her well.  Now go up into the lobby.  As you
get there she will just be coming in the front door.
Watch who approaches her.  Arrest the man with
whom she gets in conversation.  He's supposed to be
an elderly man, short, stocky, with gray hair brushed
forward of his ears, gray mustache and Imperial.  But
he may be disguised.  Arrest any man that goes up to
her and engages her in conversation.  Watch yourself
well, for he's a desperate character."
</p>

<p>
"We'll wait down here," added the Deputy
Commissioner.  "If you need help blow your whistle."
</p>

<p>
The policeman departed upstairs, and Jack ordered
the Deputy Commissioner a drink.  Jack thought he was
perfectly cool, until he became aware of a curious little
fluttering in his veins.  It became increasingly difficult
to sit still.  When the drink was brought he forgot all
about it.  He could not keep his imagination within
bounds.  He tasted the great glory that would be his
when it became known that he, single-handed, had
broken up the amazing traffic in blackmail.  He saw
himself taking his rightful place as John Farrow
Norman, and enjoying his riches with an easy mind.  He
saw Kate relenting at last.  Meanwhile his eyes were
glued to the dragging minute hand of the clock.
</p>

<p>
"Something must be the matter with that clock!" he
cried.  "Oh, this is fierce!  If I could only go up there
and see what is going on!"
</p>

<p>
"Give him time," said the Deputy Commissioner
soothingly.  "He hasn't been gone three minutes yet.
Your man may be late."
</p>

<p>
In five minutes the plainclothes man was back in the
bar.  One look in his perplexed face told Jack that
things had not gone off as he had planned.  The bright
bubble of his dreams burst.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The man shrugged.  "She wants you, the lady.  Told
me to bring you quick."
</p>

<p>
"But the man?" asked Jack as he followed him
back.
</p>

<p>
"Never came.  She hadn't any more than sat down
when a bell-hop begun paging her.  Mrs. Cleaver, he
was calling.  He had a letter for her.  She begun to
read it, and jumped up and sat down again quick.  I
thought she was going to faint, and hung around like.
She sees me looking at her and says: 'Are you the
policeman?'  I nods, and she says: 'Bring Mr. Robinson
quick.'  That's all."
</p>

<p>
They entered the lobby, and Jack saw Mrs. Cleaver
sitting in one of the big chairs.  The brave air with
which she had sailed past the window was in eclipse.
She looked limp and white.  As he came to her she held
out an open letter without speaking.  He read:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Dear Mrs. Cleaver:</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>So you have decided to turn against me&mdash;after
spending a hundred and fifty thousand of my money.
Well, that's your affair of course.  I hope you know
where you're going to get more.  This was a clumsy
trap to expect to take the old fox in.  Tell the young
secretary he will have to do better than this if he
expects to make that great reputation he is dreaming of.
Like most young men he is prone to go of at half cock.
Tell him that he had better be sure that he has anything
against me before he calls in the police.  But give
him and the Third Deputy Commissioner my regards.
They are waiting in the bar.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "<i>Cordially yours,</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>Mr. B.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap21"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Mr. B's taunting letter was a bitter dose for
Jack's pride to swallow.  Jack was young and
very human, and it was only natural he should have
been a little puffed up by his preliminary successes in a
task that might well have daunted an experienced
detective.  And then to discover after all that his crafty
adversary had only been playing with him, that he was
aware of all his movements&mdash;well, Jack ground his
teeth a bit.  But the effect on the whole was salutary.
The letter rebuked Jack's vanity, and steeled his resolution.
</p>

<p>
"I was a fool!" he told himself.  "I didn't give the
old boy credit for ordinary horse sense.  Well, I won't
make the same mistake again.  I can't do anything
more in my own character, that's certain.  He has a
perfect line on me as Bobo's secretary.  But he doesn't
know anything about Pitman yet&mdash;or young Henry
Cassels, the student at Barbarossa's school.  I'll get
him yet."
</p>

<p>
The affair of the letter resulted in the swift break-up
of Mrs. Cleaver's establishment.  Jack did not see her
again.  He instructed the bank to pay her two hundred
dollars weekly.  She rented her house and departed&mdash;for
an extensive trip through the South, it was given
out.
</p>

<p>
Miriam disappeared too.  Jack hoped that his mind
would now be relieved of any further anxiety concerning
her designs on Bobo.  She would naturally suppose
Jack thought, that in the general expose her connection
with Mr. B. would be made known to Bobo, and she
would scarcely have the effrontery to pursue him
further.  But Jack underrated that young lady's
hardihood, as will be seen.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact Jack did not feel that it was
necessary to explain to Bobo the whys and wherefors
of what had happened.  He had no confidence in Bobo's
discretion.  He ascribed Mrs. Cleaver's sudden
departure to her well-known capriciousness.  Bobo was a bit
dazed by the change in the situation, and broken-hearted
at the seeming loss of Miriam.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't I hear from her!" he cried a hundred
times a day.  "There wasn't any trouble the last time
I saw her.  You know, we went to the theater together,
and you and Clara had dinner at home.  When we
got home Clara had gone to bed with a headache,
but you were there waiting for us, and the three of us
had a rabbit together, all as jolly as possible."
</p>

<p>
"The next day when I went back to lunch the whole
house was upset.  Miriam had gone out they said, and
Clara wouldn't see me.  The butler said she was
packing.  I hung around a couple of hours, and nobody so
much as offered me a bite.  At last I had to go away
to get something to eat.  When I got back Miriam had
come in and gone again, gone for good the man said.
He had had his wages, and was openly impudent.
And she hadn't left me a line!  The next day the
whole house was closed up.  I can't understand it!
Did Clara write to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Just a line to say that she couldn't face the fag
of a New York season, and was going South for a rest."
</p>

<p>
"Let me see the letter, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I didn't keep it."
</p>

<p>
"What do you suppose has become of Miriam?"
</p>

<p>
"You can search me."
</p>

<p>
In his mind's eye Jack had a vivid picture of that
final scene between Miriam and Clara.  Figuratively
the fur must have flown!
</p>

<p>
"I can't understand it!" said poor Bobo.  "I didn't
do anything to her.  She has my address."
</p>

<p>
"Forget her!" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you never liked her!" said poor Bobo.
</p>

<p>
Bobo instituted a sort of footless search for her,
which consisted mainly in mooning around the different
places they had visited together.  Jack let him alone.
It could do no harm he thought, and it kept Bobo occupied.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the poor fellow's appetite suffered.  He
lost weight and no longer found any zest in spending
money.  He moaned in his sleep, and cried out
Miriam's name.  Jack somehow had not suspected that
a fat man might be so subjected to love's torments.
</p>

<p>
And then one night when Jack returned to dinner,
after having spent the afternoon with Anderson, he
found a change.  He first noticed it in the eagerness
with which Bobo picked up the menu card.  Finding
Jack's sharp eyes on him, he dropped it again, and said
with a sigh that he couldn't eat a thing.  But he
did&mdash;several things.  Bobo had but an imperfect command
over his facial muscles.  The corners of his mouth
would turn up.
</p>

<p>
"He has seen her," thought Jack.  "I'll have to tell
him the truth now."
</p>

<p>
"What'll we do to-night?" said Bobo casually.
</p>

<p>
"Stay home," suggested Jack.
</p>

<p>
"If you're tired you'd better turn in early," said Bobo
with deceitful solicitude.  "I'll go out for a little while.
I want to look around one or two places."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  I want to have a little talk with you
first."
</p>

<p>
Bobo's face fell absurdly.  "Oh, all right," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
When they were back in their own rooms Jack said
without preamble: "So you saw her to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Saw who?" said Bobo with innocent wide open eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Come off!  Who is it that makes your eyes shine,
and your mouth purse up in a whistle?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you're talking about!"
</p>

<p>
"We're wasting time."
</p>

<p>
"If you are referring to Miss Culbreth," said Bobo
on his dignity, "I have not seen her."
</p>

<p>
"What's the use of lying to me?  You're as
transparent as window glass!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if you've made up your mind that I'm a liar,
what's the use of my saying anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Look here.  Miriam is either what I think she is,
or what you think she is.  If she's all that's good and
pure as you think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As I <i>know</i>!" corrected Bobo.
</p>

<p>
Jack dryly accepted the correction.  "As you know.
It can't do her any harm to tell me the truth about what
happened to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I can't!" said Bobo obstinately.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose she made you promise not to tell me."
</p>

<p>
Bobo was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Now listen.  When you came with me
the first condition of our agreement was that you
should obey orders.  Isn't that so?"
</p>

<p>
Bobo nodded sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I order you to tell me what happened to-day.
That lets you out of any promise you may have
made."
</p>

<p>
Poor Bobo was quite unable to stand out against a
stronger nature.  "Oh, since you put it that way, I have
seen her."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"In the Park.  On a bench near that fountain down
the steps at the end of the Mall.  We used to sit there
sometimes in the sun.  And I just went back on a
chance&mdash;well you know!"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, I know how you feel," said Jack more
sympathetically.  "I'm sorry to see so much good feeling
wasted."
</p>

<p>
"It's not wasted.  While I was sitting there a woman
came by heavily veiled.  I didn't know her at first,
but when she saw me she gave a little cry.  It was
forced from her.  She didn't mean to let me recognize
her.  She tried to get away, but I stopped her."
</p>

<p>
Jack concealed his smile.
</p>

<p>
"It was Miriam," Bobo went on.  "And what do
you think!  Just like me she had been attracted to the
spot where we had been happy!  Wasn't that wonderful!"
</p>

<p>
"Very wonderful!" said Jack drily.
</p>

<p>
"She was so overcome she had to sit down for a
moment," Bobo continued.  "When I reproached her
for not sending me word, she said she had been so
shocked at the discovery of Mrs. Cleaver's wickedness,
she hadn't known what she was doing.  Her one idea
was to escape from that woman's house.  Why didn't
you tell me what she had been up to?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind that now.  Go on with your story."
</p>

<p>
"When she collected her wits, she said she didn't
think it was any use her writing to me, because she was
sure I would think she was mixed up in it too."
</p>

<p>
"Well that was pretty near the truth," Jack put in.
</p>

<p>
"She said she was sure you would never let such a
chance go by of turning me against her."
</p>

<p>
"But I didn't use it against her, did I?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I expect you had your own reasons.  I didn't
know what Miriam was talking about.  I begged her to
tell me what Mrs. Cleaver had been up to, but she
refused to believe that I had not been told.  Even when I
had convinced her I knew nothing she wouldn't tell me
because she didn't want to betray her cousin.  Bad as
she was, she was still her cousin, Miriam said."
</p>

<p>
"Bosh!" said Jack scornfully.  "No more her cousin
than you are!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you never believe anything Miriam says,"
complained Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Let that go for the present.  What else happened?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing much.  She was relieved to find out that
I didn't think wrong of her.  We talked&mdash;but we didn't
say much."  Bobo got red.  "Hang it all, I don't
have to tell you everything I say to a girl, do I?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Jack grinning.
</p>

<p>
"In the end I promised her I wouldn't tell you I'd
seen her.  That's all."
</p>

<p>
"And you're going to see her again, to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Y-yes."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"She's stopping temporarily at the Bienvenu."
</p>

<p>
"Now let's try and let a little light on this subject,"
said Jack.  "She's always saying that I'm trying to
turn you against her, isn't she?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and it's true."
</p>

<p>
"What reason does she give for my actions?"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Think a little.  Her idea is that I am afraid of her
influence over you, because it may threaten mine, isn't
it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p>
"And that's ridiculous, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
But Bobo was obstinately silent.
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" cried Jack.  "Are you my boss or
aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"No," muttered Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Then what possible motive could I have for wishing
to turn you against her?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Bobo sullenly.  "I can't read
your mind."
</p>

<p>
Jack threw up his hands.  "You're so stuck on your
role of multi-millionaire, that you're always forgetting
it's only a role you're playing.  Now listen.  I'm going
to tell you the whole truth about Mrs. Cleaver and
Miriam.  It's all I can do for you.  In the first place
Mrs. Cleaver has been in the pay of the old man for
three years.  It was he who supplied the coin to keep
up that house.  I caught her with the goods."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" gasped Bobo.  "A society woman like
that!  You're sure you are not mistaken?"
</p>

<p>
"Read that," said Jack, handing him Mr. B.'s letter
to Mrs. Cleaver.
</p>

<p>
Bobo's hair almost stood on end as he recognized the
handwriting, and appreciated the significance of what
he read.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but Miriam didn't know anything about this.
She said she was stunned when she learned of what her
cousin&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Please don't give me any more of that stuff.
Mrs. Cleaver was only the old man's catspaw, but Miriam
is a confidential insider."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, for one thing Mrs. Cleaver told me the old
man had sent Miriam to her."
</p>

<p>
"But you've just said the woman was a crook.  That's
no proof."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's not all I have against Miriam.  It
appears that she was practicing her wiles on Silas Gyde
before he was killed."
</p>

<p>
From his desk Jack got the unfinished letter that the
dead millionaire had left behind him.  To Bobo he read
that part of it which referred to Miriam.
</p>

<p>
Bobo was shaken but unconvinced.  "That description
might fit dozens of girls," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Sure," said Jack, "all except the peculiar mole on
the inside of her right forefinger.  Ever noticed that?"
</p>

<p>
"N-no."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I have.  If you're going to see her again, I
recommend that you look for it."
</p>

<p>
Bobo was now weakening fast "What do you suppose
her game is?"
</p>

<p>
"That's easy.  To marry you and get a strangle hold
on your supposed millions.  Now I didn't want to tell
you all this because it endangers the game I'm playing.
But I got you into it, and I don't want your blood on my
conscience either."
</p>

<p>
"My b-blood!" stammered Bobo, white as a sheet.
</p>

<p>
Jack said simply: "If you let yourself be inveigled
into marrying that girl, when she finds out you haven't
got a sou, she'll kill you.  She's that kind."
</p>

<p>
Bobo shook as with an ague.  "I'll never see her
again," he whispered.  "I swear it!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Jack&mdash;in the character of Mr. Pitman, had now
reached a degree of intimacy with Dave Anderson,
manager of the Eureka Protective Association, sufficient
to enable him to drop into Anderson's private office at
any hour during the day without exciting remark.  He
was careful never to display the least curiosity
concerning Anderson's business, but simply kept his eyes
and ears open and picked up what he could.
</p>

<p>
His patience was rewarded at last.  One morning
as he entered the private office, he found Anderson
engaged in tying up a little packet, the significant size
and shape of which made Jack's heart beat faster.
</p>

<p>
"Remittance day," said the indiscreet Anderson carelessly.
"Just wait till I get this off to the boss, and
I'll go out and have a smile with you."
</p>

<p>
Jack had instantly made up his mind to follow that
packet.  "Sorry," he said, "can't stop now.  Just
dropped in to ask you the number of your cigar-maker
on lower Sixth avenue.  I've got to go down in that
neighborhood, and I thought I'd get some."
</p>

<p>
"81 Sixth," said Anderson.  "Will we lunch to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Jack, "I'll be back in time."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Anderson was writing the address on
the packet.  Jack after considerable practice had taught
himself to read his writing upside down.  He now
read:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "MR. PETER FEATHERSTONE,<br />
  Hotel Abercrombie.<br />
  (To be called for.)"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This was all he required.  He bade Anderson
good-by, and went out.  Having plenty of time, he
proceeded in leisurely fashion to the Abercrombie, one of
the great hotels in the Thirty-Fourth street district.
He was filled with a great hope.
</p>

<p>
"Please God, I'll get him this time.  I'm safe against
recognition in the Pitman disguise.  I won't call on
any plainclothes man now, but trust to myself."
</p>

<p>
Prudence restrained him from premature rejoicings.
"No counting of chickens this time!" he warned
himself.  "Remember you're dealing with a customer as
slick as an eel.  If he slips through your fingers you've
got to be prepared to begin all over to-morrow!"
</p>

<p>
In the pillared lobby of the Abercrombie Jack
bought a newspaper, and planted himself in a chair
in such wise, that while appearing to be absorbed in
the news, he could command all that went on at the
desk.
</p>

<p>
As he was waiting there little Harmon Evers the
wig-maker passed through.  Jack, not wishing to be
recognized by any one just then, buried himself a little
deeper in his newspaper, but Evers stopped beside
him, nodding and smiling.  His expression approved
the Pitman make-up as put on by Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't have done better myself," he said.
</p>

<p>
Jack couldn't help but be flattered.  "One becomes
expert with practice," he said.
</p>

<p>
"You're on your business and I'm on mine," Evers
said with a sly smile, indicating a little satchel that
he carried.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know you had to go out to yours," said
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, there's an elderly matinee idol lives here,
who wouldn't dare leave his room until I have renovated
him.  If there was an alarm of fire before I got
here, I believe he'd burn up."
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed.
</p>

<p>
"But I see you have serious affairs on your mind.
Au revoir.  Come down to my place when you can, and
we'll talk philosophy."
</p>

<p>
With a nod and a smile he went on to the elevator.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Jack had missed nothing of what went
on at the desk.  In a short while a messenger boy
came in carrying the packet he had seen in Anderson's
hands.  It was receipted for at the desk and tossed
in the pigeonhole marked "F" of the division for
letters to be called for.
</p>

<p>
For twenty minutes thereafter Jack watched the
comedy of "The Hotel Desk" being played before him.
Unfortunately his mind was at too great a tension to
permit him to enjoy the finer shades of comedy.  He
silently swore at the crowd and the confusion which
made it well-nigh impossible for one pair of eyes to
follow all that was going on.
</p>

<p>
He concentrated on the letter box marked "F," and
watched it until his eyeballs seemed ready to crack.
</p>

<p>
Finally the hand of one of the clerks shot out to
that box, and hastily shuffling the contents, picked out
the packet again.  Jack's heart gave a jump.  He
hastily scanned the row in front of the desk at the
moment, but there was no figure among them that
answered to the descriptions of "Mr. B."  At the end
of the row was another messenger boy.  The clerk
handed the packet to him.
</p>

<p>
"Of course he wouldn't come himself," thought Jack.
</p>

<p>
Jack followed the messenger out of the hotel.  Boy-like,
he shambled up the street, whistling vociferously,
tossing the packet in the air and catching it again,
careless of the pedestrians he collided with in his
exercise.  Presumably had he known the contents he
would have treated the packet with greater respect.
</p>

<p>
He turned West in Thirty-Fourth street, stopping
to gaze in every window that attracted his attention.
Jack was hard put to it to accommodate himself to
the snail-like pace without being conspicuous.  At the
Madison avenue corner an automobile had broken
down.  The boy hailed this diversion with glee, and
Jack, too, had to stand around until the youngster had
gazed his fill.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the boy aimlessly darted across the street
like a bird&mdash;or a boy, threading his way among the
cars hurrying in both directions.  Jack almost lost him
then.  He finally picked him up on the other side,
engaged in converse with another messenger.  An
argument developed and hostilities were threatened.
</p>

<p>
"I kin lick you wit' one hand behind me."
</p>

<p>
"You're anutter!"
</p>

<p>
"Want to see me do it?"
</p>

<p>
"Ya-ah!"
</p>

<p>
"You jus' say any more and you'll see!"
</p>

<p>
"I ain't askeered of yeh, yeh big stiff!"
</p>

<p>
"You say that again!"
</p>

<p>
"Ahh!  I dare yeh to touch me!  I dare yeh!"
</p>

<p>
And so on, and so on.  Jack, feeling very foolish,
had to make out to be studying the pattern of a
rug displayed in a nearby window.  Anybody who
knows boys knows that these discussions are apt to
be kept up a long time without getting anywhere.  But
they end as suddenly as they begin.  Having exhausted
their powers of repartee they parted, instantly
forgetting each other.  Jack's quarry continued around
the corner and up Fifth avenue.
</p>

<p>
There were other interruptions; a man was painting
a sign; another was dressing a window.  Jack almost
despaired of arriving at any destination.  He wondered
if the old man was as impatiently awaiting his packet.
Finally it began to rain, and the boy mended his pace
a little.  He led Jack into the Public Library, and Jack
with an accelerated beating of the heart wondered if
the rendezvous were here.  But the boy went out again
by the Forty-Second street door, and it appeared he
had only been taking advantage of the long corridors
to walk dry shod.
</p>

<p>
The messenger darted across Forty-Second street in
his usual reckless style, and Jack found himself back
in the vicinity of the Eureka offices.  To his astonishment,
the boy turned into that very building.  Jack went
up in the elevator with him.  He got put at the fourth
floor, and entered the Eureka offices.
</p>

<p>
Jack lingered in the corridor, biting his lips in
chagrin.  All his trouble amounted to this, that he had
been led back to the point he started from.  He
wondered if it were possible that the seemingly heedless
Anderson had turned a clever trick on him.  He felt
that he had to find out at whatever risk.  He had
a good excuse to enter, for he had said he would be
back.  He entered, passing through the outer office
into Anderson's room as he was accustomed to do.
</p>

<p>
Anderson was in the act of receipting for the packet.
He greeted Jack without the least departure from his
usual careless air, and Jack felt relieved.  The boy
went out, already pursing up his lips to whistle.  It all
meant nothing to him.
</p>

<p>
Jack ventured to say with an indifferent air: "Why,
when I left you, you were just sending out a packet
like that."
</p>

<p>
"It was the very same package," Anderson replied.
"Funny thing, half an hour after I sent it the boss
called up again, and said he'd changed his mind and
wanted it at the Hotel Madagascar.  He never did
that before.  I sent after it, but the boy was so long
coming back, I went to the bank and drew more.
'Tain't healthy to keep the boss waiting too long.  I
just sent off the second lot."
</p>

<p>
"Madagascar!" thought Jack.  "My own hotel!
He has a nerve.  Maybe there's a chance to get him
there!"
</p>

<p>
"Ready for lunch?" asked Anderson.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, I can't go with you to-day," said Jack.  "I've
had a hurry call from the house to go up to Yonkers.
Just dropped in to tell you not to wait."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, too bad!" said Anderson.  "See you to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap23"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
While he descended in the elevator Jack
thought quickly.  His thoughts were not
altogether pleasant ones.  Evidently "Mr. B." or one of
his agents had seen him watching in the Abercrombie
and had taken warning.  If this were so his disguise
had been seen through.  Jack did not so much mind the
fact that his adversary had given him the slip again,
but he had counted heavily on that disguise.  And now
the whole structure that he had built upon it was crumbling.
</p>

<p>
But he was far from being discouraged.  "Mr. B."
had had the nerve to choose the Madagascar.  Very
well, he would try to call his bluff there.  Since it was
his own hotel he didn't have to waste the time to get
there.  He could telephone ahead.  He hastened to
the nearest booth.
</p>

<p>
He got the desk at the Madagascar.  Establishing
the fact that the voice on the wire was that of Baldwin,
a clerk well known to him, he said:
</p>

<p>
"This is Robinson speaking, Mr. Norman's secretary.
Do you recognize my voice?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, certainly, Mr. Robinson."
</p>

<p>
"Listen carefully.  There's a crook trying to pull
a little game on Mr. Norman, and I've framed up a
plant to get him with the goods.  Do you get me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"There's just been a package delivered to the desk
there, or will be delivered in a few minutes addressed
to Mr. Peter Featherstone, to be called for.  No, wait
a minute!  That name may have been changed&mdash;but
I'm sure about the package.  It's a small flat package
the size and shape of a bundle of greenbacks laid flat.
It's wrapped in a sheet of white typewriter paper, and
tied with a green string.  Look and see if you have
such a package there now.  I'll hold the wire."  Presently
the answer came: "Yes, sir, we have such a package,
but it's addressed to Mr. Amos Tewkesbury."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said Jack.  "The name doesn't
signify.  Now I want you to keep Connolly the house
detective within call, and have him arrest, as quietly
as possible, whoever calls for that package.  Keep the
man in the room behind the office until I can get there.
I'll go in by the side door and telephone down to you
from our suite.  Is that all clear?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly, sir."
</p>

<p>
Jack hailed a taxi and had himself carried home,
that is to say to Kate's house, where Mr. Pitman had
his ostensible domicile.  It was not the sober Mr. Pitman's
habit to employ taxis, but this was an urgent case.
Jack had to remove the Pitman make-up, of course,
before he could show himself around the Madagascar.
</p>

<p>
He hastily changed to the more elegant attire of the
millionaire's secretary, and then made his way through
the vault into Silas Gyde's old rooms, thence across
the corridor to the rear of the state apartments.
Something less than half an hour had elapsed since
he had called up Baldwin.
</p>

<p>
Bobo was there, moping in a dressing-gown while
he waited for lunch time, the only thing that relieved
his heavy hours.  He brightened a little at the sight of
some one to whom he might pour out his troubles.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I were dead!" he groaned.
</p>

<p>
Jack was in no mood to listen to him then.  He ran
to the telephone, and snatched the receiver from the
hook.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?" said Bobo, infected with his excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Give me Mr. Baldwin at the desk," Jack said to the
operator.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Baldwin.  This is Robinson.  Have you got
my man?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, we've got him all right!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!  Have him quietly brought up here."
</p>

<p>
Jack hung up the receiver and did a go-as-you-please
around the Dutch room, hurdling the chairs.  Bobo
gazed at him goggle-eyed.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"I've got him!" cried Jack.  "I've got him!  I did
it with my own little wits.  Once too often he tried to
fool me!  He was just a little too nervy trying to pull
something in my own hotel!"
</p>

<p>
"Got who?  The old man himself!" cried Bobo
amazed.
</p>

<p>
"Joy and deliverance!" sang Jack.  "All honest
millionaires can now sleep easy o' nights!"
</p>

<p>
"But what's going to become of me now?" said poor
Bobo.
</p>

<p>
Jack's transports were interrupted by a ring at the
outer door of the suite.  He ran to it and flung it open.
</p>

<p>
Bitter disappointment awaited him.
</p>

<p>
It was not the famous, much-desired "Mr. B" that
he saw outside nor was it a figure that could possibly
have taken his shape.  Connolly, the house detective,
had his huge hand on the shoulder of a slinking, weedy
youth with sallow vacuous face, and cigarette stained
fingers; in other words, the typical loafer of the Times
Square neighborhood.  Baldwin was behind the pair,
eager to see what would happen.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's not my man!" cried Jack.
</p>

<p>
There was an awkward silence.
</p>

<p>
"I followed your instructions to the letter," said
Baldwin, eager to justify himself.  "You said to arrest
any man that asked for that package.  This man asked
for it."
</p>

<p>
"Sure," said Jack quickly.  "You did right.  I'm
disappointed, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't done anything," whined the prisoner.
"What are you going to do to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Shall I let him go, sir?" boomed Connolly.
</p>

<p>
Jack roused himself.  "Not on your life," he said.
"He's got to give an account of himself.  Bring him
in and shut the door."  To the weedy youth he said:
"Who sent you here?"
</p>

<p>
The answer came voluble and craven: "I don't
know who the guy was.  I never seen him before.
Honest, I didn't know there was anything crooked in
it.  I'm no crook, boss."
</p>

<p>
"Describe the man who sent you here."
</p>

<p>
The answer came readily: "A medium old guy,
stoutish, not real fat.  Had his hair brushed in a funny
way, old-fashioned-like, and a little chin whisker."
</p>

<p>
"That's my man!" said Jack grimly.  "Where did
you meet him?"
</p>

<p>
"I was standin' in front of the pitcher theater on
Seventh below Forty-Second with some other fellows
when a big black limousine car came along and stopped
at the curb.  We all took notice of it, it was such a
long car, long as an ambulance.  The door opened
a little way, and an old guy leaned out and held up a
finger to me.
</p>

<p>
"He asks me if I want to earn a dollar, and I says
sure.  So he tells me to go to the desk of the
Madagascar, and ask for a package for Mr. Amos Tewkesbury,
and bring it to him.  But he said he wouldn't be
in the car when I got back.  He said he'd be standing
on the northwest corner of Forty-Second Street and
Seventh, and I wasn't to stop when I saw him, but just
slip him the package, and take the dollar he'd be
holding in his hand.  That's all.  I didn't see no wrong
in it."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe he's lying, sir," said Connolly.
</p>

<p>
Jack shook his head.  "Sounds like my man," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"What'll I do with him, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Let him have the package and let him go," said
Jack.
</p>

<p>
To the prisoner he said sternly: "Your story may
be true, but this is an ugly business you've mixed
yourself up in.  You'd have a hard time proving your
innocence in court.  The only way you can square
yourself is by helping us pinch this crook."
</p>

<p>
The sallow youth turned a shade paler.  "He's
stronger than me, and he's heeled," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want you to lay hands on him.  I'll take
care of that.  You follow your instructions just as he
gave them to you.  Hand him the package without
stopping.  Go quickly, and don't look behind you."
</p>

<p>
To Connolly Jack said: "Take a taxi to the corner
of Eighth and Forty-Second, and walk back on
Forty-Second.  You've heard the description of the man I
want, and the car he rides in.  If he gives me the slip,
and tries to escape towards the West, nab him."
</p>

<p>
It was still raining.  Jack snatched up an umbrella
and, opening it with his penknife, made a little
triangular cut midway in the silk.
</p>

<p>
"My disguise," he said.
</p>

<p>
The sallow youth, clasping the package, hurried out
of the hotel with Jack at his heels.  Jack raised the
umbrella and held it low over his head.  Thus while
his face was hidden from the passersby, he could still
see ahead through the little hole.  The stretch of
pavement between the Madagascar and Forty-Second
street was as thronged as it is twenty hours out of
the twenty-four, even in the rain.
</p>

<p>
They had crossed Forty-Third street and were within
two hundred feet of the appointed place.  Jack was
peering eagerly ahead through his peep-hole, when
suddenly his umbrella was knocked sideways, and a
clawlike hand clutched his wrist.  A cracked voice
squalled:
</p>

<p>
"Stop him!  He snatched my pocketbook!"
</p>

<p>
It was a bent little old woman in a queer rusty bonnet
over a brown wig.  She wore glasses so thick, that
her eyes were like little points far behind them.  She
redoubled her cries.
</p>

<p>
"He's a thief!  He stole my pocketbook!"
</p>

<p>
Jack crimsoned with anger and mortification.  He
was helpless.  To knock the old woman out of the
way would only have been to convict himself of her
preposterous charge.  In five seconds a great crowd
was pushing and shoving around them.
</p>

<p>
"All my money!  All my money!" wailed the old
woman, and actually two tears rolled down her
withered cheeks.  It was the perfection of acting.
</p>

<p>
A loud murmur of sympathy went up from the
crowd, and violent threats were made in Jack's face.
He ground his teeth in impotent rage.  Anything he
might have said would only have made matters worse.
He retained the presence of mind to keep his mouth
shut.
</p>

<p>
"Hold him!" cried the old woman.  "I'll get a policeman!"
</p>

<p>
Half a dozen pairs of hands seized Jack roughly.
The old woman threaded her way with surprising
celerity through the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Jack permitted himself to say: "You'll never see
her again.  It's a frame-up to let her and her partner
make a getaway."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up, you thief!" they roared.  "Shut up, or
we'll smash your hat over your eyes."  Those behind
who had little idea of what was going on roared out
of sympathy.
</p>

<p>
But the temper of a crowd is subject to abrupt
changes.  A minute passed and the old woman did not
return.  It suddenly struck the people that the
well-dressed Jack, proud, angry and silent, did not much
resemble a purse-snatcher.  Jack, feeling the change,
said scornfully:
</p>

<p>
"Do you see her coming back?  I tell you it's a
frame-up."
</p>

<p>
The men who had hold of Jack became uncertain,
and finally let go.  Jack elbowed his way out, and
none sought to stop him now.  The crowd dissolved.
The whole incident had occupied less than two minutes,
but that was long enough to do the mischief.  The
packet presumably had been handed over, and both
messenger and principal swallowed up.
</p>

<p>
Jack hastened over the remaining distance to the
corner of Forty-Second street.  Neither the sallow
youth nor the old gentleman with the imperial was
visible of course.  Jack hesitated at a loss which way
to turn.  There was a chance that the old man, having
received the money, had turned Westward and so might
be intercepted by Connolly, but it was a faint one.
</p>

<p>
While Jack stood there the traffic officer at that
important crossing gave the signal for the East and
West-bound traffic to cross, and a double line of cars darted
across Seventh Avenue.  Fourth in the line of those
bound East Jack saw the long black limousine that had
been so often described to him.
</p>

<p>
As it flashed by he had a glimpse of a silk-hatted
head with gray hair brushed forward of the ears, ruddy
complexion, gray moustache and imperial.  Alongside
was the rusty black bonnet and the brown wig.  The
man's head was down, and his attitude suggested he
was counting something in his lap.  The woman's glance
followed his.
</p>

<p>
It was Jack's first glimpse of his quarry, and his
hunting instinct was spurred to action.  He made a
zig-zag dash across the street under the very wheels
of motors and trolley cars.  The black limousine was
out of his reach, but by great good luck he found a
taxicab standing by the curb with its engine running.
</p>

<p>
He flung himself in, crying: "Four times your
fare if you can keep that car in sight.  A hundred
dollars if I am able to arrest the couple in it!"
</p>

<p>
The taxi leaped ahead.  Jack lowered the front
window, and leaning forward, pointed out the right
car to the chauffeur.  In a wild spurt down
Forty-Second street they gained half a block on the
limousine.  They just managed to get across Sixth avenue
before the whistle blew.  At Fifth the whole line
was held up for perhaps half a minute.  The press
was so great here, Jack could not see the black car,
but he had carefully marked its position, about six
cars ahead.
</p>

<p>
When the whistle blew for the East and West traffic
to resume they saw it turn down Fifth with a burst
of speed.  They followed.  In and out of the close
traffic the big car threaded its way with a wonderful
exhibition of sang-froid on the part of the chauffeur.
Jack had a good chauffeur too.  But a race through
such a crowd is purely a matter of luck.  They never
succeeded in getting within less than five car lengths
of their prize.  Jack saw that the black car now bore
a Georgia license.  He made note of the number.
</p>

<p>
At Thirty-Fourth street the line was held up again.
The whistle had just blown, and this promised to be a
longer stoppage.  Jack jumped out of the taxi, and ran
ahead down the line with fast beating heart.
</p>

<p>
The black limousine was empty.
</p>

<p>
Jack gritted his teeth.  "The devil's own luck favors
him," he thought.  "They must have left the car during
the block on Forty-Second."
</p>

<p>
The chauffeur had not seen him.  Jack did not
approach him, thinking it better to take a chance of
following him to his garage.  The line got in motion again,
and Jack swung himself aboard his taxi as it passed.
</p>

<p>
At Twenty-Eighth street the whistle blew just as the
black car was crossing.  It continued blithely down the
avenue, the chauffeur waggling a derisive hand outside
his car.  Jack would have risked defying the whistle,
but his way was effectually blocked by other cars in
front and on both sides.
</p>

<p>
"My luck again!" he groaned.
</p>

<p>
They were held up there while a ten-horse truck
bearing a steel girder crawled across the Avenue.  When
the whistle gave them leave to move again, the limousine
had disappeared into a side street.  They saw it
no more.
</p>

<p>
Jack had the license number, but an investigation
instituted by telegraph only proved as he expected,
that that number had been issued to some one giving
a mythical address in Atlanta.  As for notifying the
New York police, he knew very well that within half
an hour the license tags on the black limousine would
be changed.
</p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
The most indomitable spirits have their dark
hours, and this was Jack's.  He returned to the
Madagascar feeling that he had come to the end of
his resources.  It was hard to bear with the commiseration
of the hotel detective and clerk on his failure;
and he was in no mood to put up with Bobo's selfish
complaints.
</p>

<p>
Bobo's reasoning powers, as has been seen, were of
a primitive simplicity.  Like a child or a savage he was
always under the complete sway of the feeling of the
moment.  Just now he was, or thought he was, broken-hearted
over the loss of Miriam.  Forgetting that he
had given her up of his own free will, and for good
cause, he blamed Jack for all his present misery.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get him?" he asked when Jack came in.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
To say that Bobo was pleased at the escape of "Mr. B."
would be putting it too strongly, but he was certainly
not sorry to see Jack's discomfiture.
</p>

<p>
"Huh!  You're too sure of yourself!" he said.
</p>

<p>
Jack flashed an angry look at him, but said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"You always think you know more than anybody
else!" Bobo unwisely went on.  "You're always
making up your mind what people are, and telling them
what, to do, and all.  You want to regulate the
universe."
</p>

<p>
"Still thinking about that girl!" said Jack.  "Will
you please tell me what Mr. B.'s giving me the slip
has got to do with her?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm just telling you you don't know everything,"
said Bobo with a superior air.
</p>

<p>
It was too much.  Jack's patience snapped suddenly.
"You fool!  Your talk has as much sense as barnyard
cackle!  Is it my fault that you lost your head
over an adventuress?  This is the thanks I get for
trying to save you!  For Heaven's sake, go and marry
her and be damned to you!  But stop grousing about
it to me!"
</p>

<p>
He went out slamming the door, and leaving a
much-scared Bobo behind him.  Passing through the suite,
he crossed to Gyde's old rooms, and let himself through
the vault into his room in Kate's house.  There was
a great change in this room.  Under the present
régime it was a model of neatness and comfort.
</p>

<p>
Here Jack lit his pipe and flung himself down, and
a measure of peace returned to him.  There was comfort
in the silence, and in the thought of the locks that
secured him from the chatter of fools.
</p>

<p>
"The old boy wasn't so far wrong when he built
himself a refuge like this," he thought.
</p>

<p>
But by and by when the fragrant smoke had steadied
his nerves, he began to tire of solitude.  To
particularize, he desired the society of a certain person,
to wit: the mistress of the house.
</p>

<p>
In order to see her it was necessary for him to
assume the Pitman make-up.  Much against his will&mdash;he
was thinking of putting Mr. Pitman out of the way
now, he arrayed himself in that character, and sallied
forth in search of Kate.
</p>

<p>
He found her in her own sunny sitting-room on the
floor above.  The old-fashioned mother was there too.
Mrs. Storer was not in the secret of Jack's disguise.
She considered Mr. Pitman rather a common fellow,
but was always polite.  Now after a few minutes' small
conversation, she recollected an errand in her
well-trained way, and left the room.
</p>

<p>
Kate was sewing.  The needle became her better
than the typewriter.  As mistress of a house she seemed
to have discovered her true vocation.  It may be
mentioned in passing that this establishment was a success,
and was already paying its way.
</p>

<p>
"We don't see much of you now," said Kate.
</p>

<p>
"It's not from not wanting to on my part," he said,
watching her dreamily.  "But a twenty-four hour day
scarcely gives you time enough to play one part, let
alone two or three."  The sunlight behind her was
making a little halo in the edges of her dark hair, and he
scarcely knew what his tongue was saying.
</p>

<p>
"How are things going?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
The consciousness of defeat still rankled in Jack's
breast; he felt a very natural desire to shine in
somebody's eyes, so he said carelessly:
</p>

<p>
"My net is closing around the old man.  He can't
escape me now.  I'll gather him in, when my case is
complete."
</p>

<p>
"Fine!" said Kate.
</p>

<p>
But Jack could not be sure there was not a faint ring
of irony in her voice.  He never could be sure of Kate.
</p>

<p>
"All my lines are working well," he went on.  "I
had a glimpse of the old man to-day, but I thought
it was better to let him go for awhile.  I'm not sure of
being able to convict him."
</p>

<p>
"This morning when you left this house I believe you
were followed," said Kate.
</p>

<p>
Jack was not going to admit just then that there was
anything he had overlooked.  "Oh, I think not."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I noticed a man standing at the corner looking
at this house.  His hat was pulled down over his
eyes.  As soon as you went out he disappeared."
</p>

<p>
"I take precautions against being trailed," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"And I believe somebody has been tampering with
the servants," Kate went on.  "Yesterday I found
Bessie, the upstairs girl, exhibiting entirely too much
curiosity as to the arrangements of your room.  I shall
let her go at the end of the week."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't possible they could have discovered the
secret of this house," said Jack.  Something told him
he was talking fatuously, but a little devil of perversity
held sway over him for the time being.
</p>

<p>
"You know best of course," said Kate.
</p>

<p>
This time he was almost sure he heard the ironical
note, and he glanced at her uneasily.  But the dark
head was bent too low over her work for him to read
her face.  He felt a mighty desire to humble this cool
and scornful maid, and changed his tack.
</p>

<p>
"You're looking very charming to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you."
</p>

<p>
He got up, and sat as close to her as he could pull
a chair.
</p>

<p>
"Go back where you were," she said calmly.
</p>

<p>
"I won't!" he said masterfully.
</p>

<p>
"Then I will."  And she changed to the chair he
had left.
</p>

<p>
Jack glowered at her.  "One would think I spread
a contagion."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know I don't care particularly for Mr. Pitman."
</p>

<p>
"That's only an excuse.  It's me you don't care for."
</p>

<p>
She laughed tantalizingly.  Jack saw now that he
had started wrong but didn't quite see how to repair
the original mistake.  He got up to go.  He knew that
if he lost his temper, he would be completely at her
mercy.
</p>

<p>
"I'd better go if we're only going to quarrel," he
muttered.
</p>

<p>
"Who's quarreling?  Can't you take a joke?"
</p>

<p>
"It's like a flick of the whip on the raw."
</p>

<p>
He had sounded the right note at last.  She heard
the real pain in his voice, and jumped up, careless of
where the sewing went.
</p>

<p>
"Jack, wait a minute!  What's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
He paused with his hand on the door-knob.  "Nothing."
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" she repeated.  "I insist on
knowing!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, things have gone a bit wrong.  What do
you care?"
</p>

<p>
She actually stamped her foot.  "How dare you speak
to me that way!  You came in here like the Lord
Hereditary Marshal of England.  How was I to know?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I didn't want to let on that I had balled things
up," he said sheepishly.
</p>

<p>
"You idiot!  Will you ever learn the first rudiments
of sense?  Sit down here!"  She pulled him down
beside her Pitman make-up and all.  "Now tell me all
about it!"
</p>

<p>
Jack looked at her a little dazed by this sudden
change of front.  "Why&mdash;I thought you were just
having a little fun with me."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I was.  You asked for it.  Whenever you
take that 'my poor little woman' tone with me, you
simply give me a pain.  But if you are really up against
it&mdash;Ah!"
</p>

<p>
Her voice caught on a deep low note of tenderness.
Jack gave up all thoughts of mastery; he would have
been quite content to kiss her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am up against it," he said quite humbly
and naturally&mdash;and told her all about it.
</p>

<p>
She said nothing until he was through; then:
"There's no occasion to be cast down that I can see.
You and the old man are playing a close game, and
he's turned a trick on you.  But the game's not over
yet."
</p>

<p>
"He's so darn sure of himself!" grumbled Jack.
"He knows what I have on him, but he goes around
quite openly in his old black hearse!  Shows himself
everywhere.  Goes on making his blackguardly collections
right under my nose.  He seems to enjoy playing
with me."
</p>

<p>
"That's a kind of vanity," said Kate.  "I have read
that criminals often display it.  It is that very thing
that will surely deliver him into your hands in the end
if you bide your time.  Some day he is bound to take
a chance too many."
</p>

<p>
Jack began to feel comforted.  "I believe I could
have him arrested to-morrow if I gave his description
to the police," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Then why don't you?"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head obstinately.  "I've got to do this
myself.  I've sworn it.&mdash;But how does he know I'm
not going to turn over my case to the police?  He
seems to be able to read my mind!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there's no magic in that.  He watches you of
course, and anybody who knew anything about you
must know that you would feel that way."
</p>

<p>
There was subtle flattery in this, and Jack began
to feel warm about the heart once more.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he hasn't put me out of the game yet, though
on this deal he has certainly called all my tricks.  The
minute I tried to use Mrs. Cleaver he trumped her.
He has called the Pitman disguise, and he must know
about my connection with Anderson.  If he has spotted
me coming out of this house, he must have guessed
that there is a way through from the hotel.  I'll have
to think up an entirely new combination."
</p>

<p>
"How does the situation stand with the anarchists?"
asked Kate.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing new down there since I told you.  I am
now a full member of the circle that Emil Jansen
belonged to, but so far I have not succeeded in
establishing 'Mr. B's' connection with it.  I know there is a
connection, because the murderers of both Ames Benton
and Silas Gyde graduated from that circle.  I
have to move slowly there."
</p>

<p>
"Then there is the girl Miriam," suggested Kate.
"I believe you could do something with her.  Do you
know where she is now?"
</p>

<p>
"Bobo told me she was at the Hotel Bienvenu.  But
she hates me like poison."
</p>

<p>
Kate smiled a little.  "From what you've told me
about her I gathered that she had a weakness of vanity,
too.  She was piqued because you resisted her charms.
Why don't you look her up and well&mdash;not resist them
quite so hard?"
</p>

<p>
"Kate!" he said scandalized.
</p>

<p>
"What?" she said with an innocent air.
</p>

<p>
"You recommend me to do that!"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  We don't owe her any consideration, I
suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's not that.  But if you cared about me the
least little bit, you wouldn't be handing me over to
another woman."
</p>

<p>
"That's up to you.  I couldn't be jealous of one like
Miriam.  If you are in any danger from that source,
Mercy!  I don't want you."
</p>

<p>
"In other words you know you've got me thrown
and hog-tied!" he said scowling.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be vulgar.  This is simply business.  You
really have a chance of getting somewhere through
her. The old man will be sending her remittances now.
If you could trace one of those back to its source&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Good!  That's an idea!  I think I see my way,
too."  His lassitude was gone.  A fresh determination
filled him.  "Kate, you are my good fairy!" he cried.
"You have put new life into me!  I am going to start
to work again this very minute!"
</p>

<p>
She said nothing, but her eyes were bright.
</p>

<p>
At the door of the room he paused, holding her
hand.  "You might let me kiss you before I go," he
said diffidently.  "Just as a kind of encouragement to
go in and win."
</p>

<p>
Kate smiled.  "That's the first time you ever asked
me with becoming modesty.&mdash;Once.  Right here."  She
put her finger on the dimple in her right cheek.
</p>

<p>
He did.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
When Jack got back to the Madagascar, Bobo
had gone out.  Jack was relieved not to find
him.  Full of his new plans, he went on down to the
office.  He was now attired again his proper person as
Mr. Robinson of course.  He looked up Baldwin at the
desk.  Baldwin naturally was keen to know more about
the mysterious case that Jack was engaged on.
</p>

<p>
"Baldwin, I've got a new line on my man," said Jack.
"Do you happen to know any of the men behind the
desk at the Bienvenu?"
</p>

<p>
"Surest thing you know.  I've got a pal there.  Name
of Dick Starr."
</p>

<p>
"What's his job?"
</p>

<p>
"Room clerk.  One of the head men."
</p>

<p>
"Will you introduce me?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure!  When?"
</p>

<p>
"The sooner the better."
</p>

<p>
"I'm coming off duty now.  I'll go right down there
with you."
</p>

<p>
Starr of the Bienvenu proved to be just such another
suave and irreproachable man of the world as Baldwin,
but somewhat older.  He knew all about Jack; no
doubt the two friends had discussed him.  While the
real secret of Jack's identity was safe, it was
understood among those whose business it was to inform
themselves of such matters, that the secretary was the
real power behind the Norman throne.  Consequently
he enjoyed more than the usual consideration shown
to a multi-millionaire's secretary.
</p>

<p>
Starr took them into a little room behind the office.
</p>

<p>
Jack said: "The fact is, I'm doing a bit of detective
work for my employer, and one of my clues leads to
the Bienvenu.  I want your help."
</p>

<p>
"Anything in my power!" Starr assured him.
</p>

<p>
"You have a young lady stopping here called Miriam
Culbreth?"
</p>

<p>
Starr nodded.  "Some Cleopatra!" he murmured.
</p>

<p>
"The same," said Jack.  "Now some time during the
next few days I have reason to believe that a package
will be sent her by messenger.  Small, flat packet about
three inches by seven."
</p>

<p>
"Packages don't go through the desk."
</p>

<p>
"But in this case I am pretty sure the boy will be
instructed to hand it to her personally."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, in that case&mdash;Want me to have a look in it?"
</p>

<p>
"Simpler than that!" said Jack.  "Just get me that
boy's number so I can trace him."
</p>

<p>
Starr assured Jack that he would be happy to serve
him.  He seemed a little disappointed that he was not
called upon to play a more important part.
</p>

<p>
They strolled out into the lobby again, and at that
identical instant Miriam herself came through the
revolving doors.  But Jack saw her first.
</p>

<p>
"Duck, you fellows!  Duck!" he whispered swiftly.
"Make out you don't know me!"
</p>

<p>
Messrs. Baldwin and Starr being experienced men
of the world, knew how to act.  They inconspicuously
faded from Jack's side.
</p>

<p>
Miriam in sables and paradise plumes swam into
the Bienvenu like a swan.  Not a man in the place but
drew a long breath of longing at the sight of her and
looked enviously at the man slinking at her heels.
Your haughty beauty always brings a man with her
like a small dog on a leader.
</p>

<p>
This man was Bobo.
</p>

<p>
Jack went up to them with glad smiles.  "Hello!
This is a surprise!"
</p>

<p>
It was manifestly a surprise to <i>them</i>.  Bobo turned
a delicate pea green shade, and had nothing to say.
The girl smiled charmingly, but her eyes were like two
points of ice.
</p>

<p>
Jack thought: "She thinks I've tracked them here.
There's something up.  I'll find out what it is."
</p>

<p>
"We just dropped in for tea," said Miriam languidly.
</p>

<p>
"Fine!" said Jack.  "I'm starving!  I'll join you."
</p>

<p>
She laughed like icicles tinkling.  "Hadn't you
better wait until&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!  What's an invite between friends!" said
Jack.  "Come on, I'll blow."
</p>

<p>
Miss Culbreth was a resourceful person, and eminently
self-possessed, but for once Jack had the satisfaction
of putting her out of countenance.  She turned
indignantly to Bobo, as if to call upon him to assert
himself, but seeing that she could expect no help from
that stricken figure, she hung her head uncertainly.
Jack led the pair of them like lambs to the slaughter
to the tea room.
</p>

<p>
Passing the elevators Bobo said huskily: "Thought
you were going upstairs to dress."
</p>

<p>
"I won't bother now," she said.
</p>

<p>
Jack thought: "Wouldn't leave him alone with
me for a farm!"
</p>

<p>
As a tea-party, the half hour that followed was not
a howling success.  Bobo crouched in his chair avoiding
Jack's eye like a guilty spaniel.  Miriam kept her
eyes down too, but for a different reason; she didn't
want Jack to see the hatred that burned there.  The
tapering white hand trembled a little in the business of
pouring tea.
</p>

<p>
The onus of keeping things going was therefore
upon Jack.  Something humorous in the situation
excited his risibilities.  He experienced a pleasant malice
in making out to the others that he saw nothing out
of the way.  He rattled on like a youth without a care
in the world.  Anything furnished him with a cue.
</p>

<p>
"See that old girl in crimson velvet.  The famous
Mrs. Paul Towers.  Used to be Mrs. Peter Vesey.
Sold herself to Peter in order to buy Paul, the saying
is around town.  That's Paul Towers with her.
Exactly half her age.  Poor devil!  He pays high for
his meals.  They say he has to turn in an itemized
expense account like a traveling salesman."
</p>

<p>
"He's not the only parasite in town," remarked
Miriam acidly.
</p>

<p>
Jack chuckled.  "Bless your heart, no!  The woods
are full of us!  What's a handsome young man with
delightful manners and not a cent to his name going
to do!"
</p>

<p>
Miriam snorted scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"But I tell you it's no cinch to be a parasite,"
continued Jack.  "It requires qualifications of a very high
order.  Firstly, a resolute determination not to work.
Any fool can work, but it needs character to idle
gracefully.  Then a parasite must have A1 cheek, nerve,
brass, gall.  It takes an unusual man to make a success
of it."
</p>

<p>
"You're forgetting some of the qualifications," said
Miriam.
</p>

<p>
"I daresay.  It's an all round man's job."
</p>

<p>
"Meanness, obsequiousness, conceit!"
</p>

<p>
"All very fine qualities!" said Jack with inimitable
gravity.
</p>

<p>
They had been at the table about half an hour when
a boy passed through the tea room paging Miss
Culbreth.  Miriam and Bobo both affected not to hear
him, but Jack, scenting developments, called him to
their table, and indicated Miriam to him.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Spragge is calling," the boy said to Miriam.
"Said he was expected."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him I'm engaged, and he needn't wait," said
Miriam languidly.  "Say that I will let him hear from
me."
</p>

<p>
Jack noticed that Bobo was betraying an extraordinary
agitation.  Following a sudden impulse, Jack said
carelessly to the boy:
</p>

<p>
"Who is Mr. Spragge, son?"
</p>

<p>
Fire flashed from Miriam's eyes, but before she
could stop the boy he had answered involuntarily:
"The reverend Mr. Spragge, sir.  Parson lives in the
house here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Jack drily.
</p>

<p>
The boy departed.
</p>

<p>
There was silence at the table.  The constraint which
had formerly lain upon them was as the gayety of a
childish game to this.  Miriam had turned very pale,
and she was breathing quickly&mdash;signs of rage in her.
Bobo's chin lay on his breast, and he was visibly
desirous of slipping right under the table cloth.
</p>

<p>
Jack enjoyed his little triumph in silence.  A single
word would have precipitated an explosion from Miriam.
For reasons of his own Jack wished to avoid a
general show-down, and he did not speak it.
</p>

<p>
He presently resumed the feather-brained rattle, and
the tension was a little relieved.  The simple-minded
Bobo cheered up, evidently having persuaded himself
that Jack had attached no significance to the mention
of the parson.  But the girl knew better.  She watched
Jack with somber eyes, waiting for him to unmask his
guns.
</p>

<p>
When they had finished their tea Jack ostentatiously
consulted his watch.  "By George!  We'll have to be
getting back to the Madagascar!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Who's we?" asked Miriam with a sneer.
</p>

<p>
"Bobo and I.  Mr. Delamare's dining with us
to-night," Jack lied glibly.
</p>

<p>
"Is that true?" Miriam demanded of Bobo.
</p>

<p>
Poor Bobo lacked the backbone to come out flatly
for either one side or the other.  He fidgetted
miserably.  "I don't know.  Maybe.  I forget."
</p>

<p>
Miriam's luscious mouth had become a thin red line.
"He can't go.  He has an engagement with me."
</p>

<p>
"Now that's too bad!" said Jack with deceitful
solicitude.  "He can't disappoint a big man like
Mr. Delamare.  Besides, there are important matters to
be decided."
</p>

<p>
Miriam was near the fulminating point.  She looked
stormily at Bobo.  "Well?  Have you nothing to say?
It's up to you!"
</p>

<p>
Bobo made a pitiable attempt to assert himself, but
he could not meet Jack's eye.  "I didn't know he was
coming," he muttered.  "I can't go now.  Anyway you
know about everything.  You can talk to him."
</p>

<p>
"There are papers to be signed," said Jack.  "I can't
do that."
</p>

<p>
Bobo hung in an abject state of indecision.
</p>

<p>
Miriam could stand no more.  She kept her voice
low out of respect to the other people in the tea room,
but her words lost none of their force thereby.  "Are
you going to sit there and let this nobody tell you what
to do?  If you've got a spark of manliness, why don't
you put him in his place?  He mocks you to your
face!  His very look is an insult to me!  Are you going
to stand for that?  Why don't you invite him to kick
you while he's at it?"
</p>

<p>
Jack thought: "Good Lord!  Will he still want to
marry her after getting such a taste of her quality as
that?"
</p>

<p>
Bobo still hung his head.  Jack could not but feel
a certain pity for him.  After all it was he, Jack, who
had got him into this mess.
</p>

<p>
"If you won't tell him I will!" said Miriam.  She
turned her blazing eyes on Jack.  "Go!  And the
next time wait until you are asked, before you thrust
yourself on your betters!  You are only an upper
servant.  You have presumed on his good nature until
now you think you are the master.  I warn you you'll
find a different kind of person in me!  I can keep you
in your place!"
</p>

<p>
Jack received this with a smile.  He was thinking:
"You are not Mrs. Norman yet, my lady!"
</p>

<p>
She read the thought as clearly as if it had been
spoken.  "I'm not afraid of you!  You can't stop me
in anything I mean to do!  I despise you!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's virtue in frankness," murmured Jack.
"But let's not rattle the family skeleton in public."
</p>

<p>
It was true, people were beginning to look
curiously towards their table.
</p>

<p>
"After all, it's a simple matter," Jack went on, "and
it's entirely up to Bobo.  Bobo, are you coming with
me, or are you going to stay here?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll stay," muttered Bobo sullenly.
</p>

<p>
Miriam smiled triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
Jack appeared to give in good-humoredly.  "Suits
me," he said.
</p>

<p>
They rose from the table.  Out in the corridor while
Jack and Bobo were obtaining their hats and coats,
there was a brief moment during which they were out
of hearing of Miriam.
</p>

<p>
"Bobo," said Jack firmly, "if you don't come home
with me, I swear I'll tell her the truth and leave you
to your fate!"
</p>

<p>
Bobo was like a poor little grain of wheat between
two hard mill-stones.  He shivered.  "How can I get
away from her?" he whined.  Obviously he was more
afraid of Miriam than of Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Leave that to me," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Miriam was watching them suspiciously.  They rejoined
her.  At the elevator she said offhand to Bobo:
</p>

<p>
"You may come up.  I have a sitting-room."
</p>

<p>
Miriam entered the elevator in advance, of course.
Jack took a firm grip of Bobo's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Well, good-by," said Jack pleasantly.  He squeezed
Bobo's arm suggestively.
</p>

<p>
"G-good-by," stammered Bobo.  "I have to go with
Jack."
</p>

<p>
Whereupon Jack turned him about smartly, and
marched him out towards the main entrance.  Miriam
gasped.  She could not very well run after them, and
grab Bobo's other arm.  Indeed, while she stared
speechless, the elevator door was closed, and she was
whirled aloft.  If looks could kill Jack had fallen dead
in his tracks!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Jack and Bobo returned to the Madagascar without
exchanging a word.  When they were alone in
their rooms, Jack looked at him and said:
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce am I going to do with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Best to let me alone," said Bobo sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't I convince you to-day that she was a crook?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care."
</p>

<p>
"That was a nice little sample of her temper that
she gave us at the table.  Do you want to let yourself
in for a lifetime of that?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't help myself."
</p>

<p>
Jack threw up his hands.  There was a silence.  Bobo
was gloomily drawing an imaginary pattern on the
arm of his chair.
</p>

<p>
"You swore to me you would never see her again,"
Jack presently resumed.  "Yet an hour ago you were
on your way downtown to get a license, weren't you?"
</p>

<p>
Bobo's hang-dog silence was equal to a confession.
</p>

<p>
"How did you expect to keep it out of the papers?"
</p>

<p>
"Bribed the clerk."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what the penalty is for marrying a
woman under another man's name?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care."
</p>

<p>
"What cock and bull story did she tell you to-day
to change you again?"
</p>

<p>
"She told me the truth."
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed.
</p>

<p>
"She admitted she'd been working for the old man.
But when she found out what his game really was she
chucked him.  Now she's actually in danger of her
life from him."
</p>

<p>
"Not too much danger, I guess," said Jack.  "You
still intend to marry her?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I've got to.  It's my fate."
</p>

<p>
"Lord preserve us!" cried Jack in a kind of helpless
exasperation.  "I really don't see what there is
to do, then, but kick you out!"
</p>

<p>
"You won't do that," said Bobo sullenly.  "You
bluffed me just now down at the Bienvenu, but I've been
thinking it over.  I know you won't do it now."
</p>

<p>
"Why won't I?"
</p>

<p>
"You can't afford to.  It would spoil all your plans."
</p>

<p>
This was true, but Jack had not given Bobo credit
for the shrewdness to perceive it.  He tried a new
course.
</p>

<p>
"Do you still believe that Miriam is marrying you
for love alone?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care!" said Bobo recklessly.  "I'm willing
to take her on any terms.  What chance has a man
like me of winning a woman like her ordinarily?  It's
gone too far now.  I've got to have her.  She's in my
blood!"
</p>

<p>
Jack looked at him with a kind of respect.  "Well,
anyhow you're in earnest.  I will give you credit for
that.  But seriously, what are you going to do
afterwards?  You don't suppose I'm going to lend you
my name and my money for the rest of your life?"
</p>

<p>
Bobo shook his head.  "I know the show-down's
got to come some day, perhaps soon.  But I'll make
a sneak before that comes.  At least I'll be happy for
awhile."
</p>

<p>
"On my money?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what's a few thousands to you?  Anyhow you
got me into this."
</p>

<p>
There was truth in this, and Jack felt certain
compunctions.  But he was amused at the naïve villainy
Bobo proposed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't grudge you the money," he said smiling.
"In a way I sympathize with you, since I see you're
really hard hit.  But I can't be a party to any such
scheme.  In the first place as your friend I've got to
save you from yourself.  You'll get over this, hard as
it seems.  Secondly, even though she is a crook, she's
entitled to be protected from a game like this.  Why
it wouldn't be a marriage at all!"
</p>

<p>
"You'd best let me be," said Bobo sullenly.  "You
can't lock me up, and I warn you I'll do it the first
chance I get."
</p>

<p>
"Don't dare me to prevent you," said Jack softly.
"I might find a way."
</p>

<p>
No more was said about the matter, but Jack continued
to think about it.  "Bobo put the idea into my
head himself," he considered.  "Lock him up!  Why
not?  He's no better than a madman for the time
being."
</p>

<p>
They patched up a temporary truce.  Bobo agreed
not to try to see Miriam that night, provided Jack
would let him make a date with her over the
telephone.  He called her up in Jack's hearing.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be there to-morrow at eleven.  No, I have not
changed.  Have him there at eleven."
</p>

<p>
Jack made no further objections.  Had Bobo been
wiser, his friend's apparent complaisance would have
aroused his suspicions.
</p>

<p>
The two young men dined together, and spent the
evening at the theater in perfect amity.  Before going
to sleep that night Jack perfected his plans.
</p>

<p>
"Having plenty of money certainly simplifies things,"
he said to himself.
</p>

<p>
Jack was always up at least an hour before Bobo.
His first act in the morning was to telephone
Mrs. Lizzie Regan, his landlady in humbler days, and still
his faithful friend.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Regan," said he, "I need your help.  Can
you give up to-day to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, Mr. Nor-Robinson, my dear!  Anything to
oblige."
</p>

<p>
"Well, come over to the Madagascar, and have
breakfast with me."
</p>

<p>
"What, me!  Eat in the Madagascar!  I'll have
to dress."
</p>

<p>
"Heavens, no!  I'm in a hurry!  We'll eat in our
suite."
</p>

<p>
"And me a respectable widow woman!  Laws, what
would the neighbors say!"
</p>

<p>
"But you'll come?"
</p>

<p>
"Will a cat lap cream, my dear!"
</p>

<p>
While he waited for her, Jack collected every scrap
of wearing apparel in Bobo's room, and the closet
adjoining, and carrying it all to another clothes closet,
locked it up and pocketed the key.  Bobo slept the
sleep of the hearty eater throughout.  Jack then cut
the wires of the telephone in his room, and removed
the instrument.  Finally he locked the three doors
leading out of Bobo's rooms, and carried away the
keys.
</p>

<p>
Bobo still slept on while Jack and Mrs. Regan
discussed an excellent breakfast in the Dutch room.  The
honest lady was greatly impressed by her surroundings.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, it's a proud day for me to be eating in such
style along with one of my own boys that I once
passed the beans to.  Sure if I'd foreseen this day,
I would have given you two eggs to your breakfast,
though I will say I never tried to stint the normal
appetite of a man!"
</p>

<p>
"My appetite must have been abnormal, I guess."
</p>

<p>
"Go along!  I lost money on you regular!"
</p>

<p>
"Maybe you won't be so glad you came to-day, when
you learn what I want you to do."
</p>

<p>
"Anything short of murder, my dear.  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
Jack told her the story of Miriam and Bobo&mdash;with
reservations.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, if it was me, I'd let her marry him.  Maybe
it would teach the hizzy a lesson.  But I suppose
you're right.  If more hot-blooded young people were
locked up at such times, marriage wouldn't be such a
joke in the vaudeville houses."
</p>

<p>
"I've got to be out a good part of the day on
business," Jack went on, "so I've got to have somebody
to look after him.  I asked you to come firstly, because
you know the truth about us, and secondly because
I thought if he tried to assault you he'd find his
match."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, I'll soothe him like his own mother.&mdash;I
brought my umbrella.  It's a good strong one."
</p>

<p>
Before going out Jack went into Bobo's room.  The
plump youth, yawning and stretching, was just
beginning to think about getting up.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Bobo," said Jack crisply.  "You've got
to stay in bed to-day.  I've hidden all your clothes.
I've engaged a nurse to look after you&mdash;and she'll see
that you get your meals.  You'd best take it quietly, for
I'm giving it out that you've been on a tear, and if
you make a racket people will think it's the D.T.'s."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;what&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;?" stammered Bobo.
</p>

<p>
Jack slipped out before he had fully recovered his
power of speech.  He delivered the key of his room
to Mrs. Regan.
</p>

<p>
On his way out Jack sought Baldwin the clerk.  "Mr. Norman
is sick," he said.  "To tell the truth, he's been
hitting too swift a pace lately.  The doctor has
ordered absolute quiet, and I want you to see that he is
not disturbed under any pretext whatever, while I'm
out.  I've left him in charge of a nurse."
</p>

<p>
Baldwin, the discreet, raised no awkward questions
about the suddenness of Bobo's attack, nor where the
doctor had come from, but assured Jack that his
orders would be obeyed.
</p>

<p>
"You remember the lovely lady we saw yesterday?"
Jack went on.
</p>

<p>
"Rather!"
</p>

<p>
"Supposing she comes here and shows a disposition
to make a scene, introduce her to Connolly the house
detective, see?  Tip Connolly off to ask her if she
didn't once go under the name of Beatrice Blackstone
and do typewriting work for Silas Gyde here.  That
ought to calm her."
</p>

<p>
At the newsstand Jack bought a copy of a yachting
magazine and from the advertising pages picked out the
address of a leading firm of yacht brokers.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later he was seated opposite the head
of that firm, a trig little man with apple cheeks and
shiny pink pate&mdash;he need not be named.  Every yachtsman
knows him.
</p>

<p>
"I represent a well-known millionaire," said Jack,
"before I give you his name, or open my business with
you, I must ask you to pledge yourself to regard it as
confidential."
</p>

<p>
The broker agreed without reservations.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Jack, "my name is Robinson, and my
employer is Mr. John Farrow Norman."
</p>

<p>
As always, this announcement produced a well-nigh
magical effect.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Norman is sick," Jack went on, "the fact is
he's been going the pace, rather, since he came into
his money, and now he's got to pull up with a round
turn."
</p>

<p>
The broker expressed a discreet sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"He has instructed me to charter a steam yacht for
a Southern cruise, a roomy, comfortable boat.  The
main consideration is to get something that's all ready
to go."
</p>

<p>
"It is fortunate that you came to me, Mr. Robinson,"
said the little broker solemnly.  "As it happens
I have the very thing you want.  I refer to the
<i>Columbian</i>, Colonel Oliver Stackpoole's yacht.  Perhaps
you know her?"
</p>

<p>
Jack shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"One of the finest yachts afloat, sir!  Three hundred
feet long, and a veritable floating palace!  Only
yesterday Colonel Stackpoole and a party of friends
returned on her from a hunting trip to Jekyl Island.
I have just received the Colonel's note authorizing me
to charter her for the Florida season.  She has a full
complement of men, a complete inventory of stores,
she is coaling this minute, and actually has steam up!"
</p>

<p>
"That sounds promising," said Jack.  "How about
terms?"
</p>

<p>
He agreed without batting an eye to the figure
named, and the little broker was sorry he had not
asked double.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go and look at her," said Jack.  "If everything
is O.K. you shall have a check this afternoon,
and we'll sail to-night."
</p>

<p>
The yacht-broker wished that Heaven might send
him such clients oftener.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Columbian</i> was lying at a coal dock in Hoboken.
It was a matter of half an hour to reach her in the
automobile.  Jack fell in love with her at sight, and
registered a silent vow, that some day when his work
was done he would own her outright&mdash;or one like her.
</p>

<p>
Though really a great ocean-going vessel, her clipper
bows, low hull, raking masts and great funnel conveyed
an impression of extreme lightness and grace.  She was
painted black with a green streak at the water line,
and her funnel was yellow.
</p>

<p>
Going aboard, Jack was astonished at the great
spread of her decks; almost room enough to drive his
car around her; and still more at the size and number
of her cabins.  Outside, the designer's effort had been
to make the <i>Columbian</i> as shipshape as possible, but
below decks he had aimed to make her passengers
forget they were at sea.
</p>

<p>
On the main deck there was a long suite of lofty
rooms; grand saloon, music room, library, smoke
room.  Overhead forward was the dining-saloon, and
a sun parlor aft.  All these rooms had open fireplaces,
windows, and other comforts not generally associated
with the sea.  The furnishings were beautiful without
being too ostentatious.  The sleeping cabins were
marvels of spaciousness and luxury.
</p>

<p>
Jack did not hesitate a moment about taking her.
His one regret was that he could not go on the first
projected cruise.  The fact that the mere signing of his
name put him in possession of this wonderful vessel
gave him a fuller realization of the power of his wealth
than he had yet experienced.
</p>

<p>
He learned that the <i>Columbian</i> would finish coaling
during the afternoon.  He arranged to have her
continue to lie where she was until nine o'clock that night.
Thus he could get his party aboard in this out-of-the-way
spot after darkness had fallen.  The <i>Columbian</i>
was then to drop down-stream to an anchorage in
the Bay, and proceed to sea next morning.  Her
Captain was instructed to see to the necessary clearance
papers.
</p>

<p>
Jack repeated his story of Mr. Norman's illness
to the captain.  The suggestion was that the millionaire's
mind was slightly affected, and they might be
prepared for vagaries.  The itinerary of the cruise
was to include Charleston, Jacksonville, Nassau and
Havana.
</p>

<p>
All arrangements having been completed, Jack
returned to the Madagascar.  Nothing untoward had
occurred in his absence.  Miriam had come as he
expected, no doubt with every intention of making a
scene; but his ruse to confront her with Connolly had
worked effectually.  She had departed quicker than she
came.
</p>

<p>
Upstairs Mrs. Regan reported all well.  Finding his
"nurse" proof against the most tearful and passionate
appeals, Bobo had resigned himself to his lot.  Indeed,
who shall say but that he was not secretly relieved thus
to have the responsibility of making a decision taken
from him.
</p>

<p>
Jack told Mrs. Regan what he had done.  An assiduous
reader of the newspapers, it appeared that she
knew all about the magnificence of the <i>Columbian</i>.
</p>

<p>
"How would you like to take a cruise in her?" Jack
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Me!  Oh law!  What a life of adventure!"
</p>

<p>
"You shall have a stateroom de luxe, with a brass
bedstead, and a dressing-table furnished with gold!"
</p>

<p>
"What me!  Lizzie Regan!  Oh law!"
</p>

<p>
"Can you get away to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd chuck a dozen boarding-houses for such a
chance!  Sure!  As it happens the house is full, and
I've got a cook who is not quite feeble-minded.  My
cousin will run in and keep an eye on things."
</p>

<p>
"That's settled then.  Run along and get ready, and
I'll watch Bobo till you get back."
</p>

<p>
Bobo listened to the plan of the proposed cruise in
sullen apathy.  Jack could not tell what he meditated
doing.  In order to be on the safe side, Jack called
on Hugh Brome, his lawyer, to assist him with the
evening's arrangements.  It promised to be a great
lark&mdash;for everybody except Bobo.
</p>

<p>
At nine o'clock that night an invalid completely
swathed in blankets was tenderly carried out of the
private side door of the Madagascar by two friends,
and placed in a waiting limousine.  A comfortable-looking
nurse hovered over him solicitously.  Any passerby
might have been surprised to hear convulsive giggles
from the three attendants&mdash;but perhaps he would
have put it down to nervousness.  Obviously the patient
was very sick.  But if the wrappings had fallen away
from his head, the passerby would certainly have been
astonished to see that he was gagged!
</p>

<p>
An hour later Jack and Hugh Brome stood on the
coal dock watching the superb vessel back out into the
river.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's out of harm's way for awhile," said
Jack.  "He has no clothes aboard but dressing-gowns
and slippers!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap27"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Nowadays it is difficult for the great to conceal
their movements.  In spite of the precautions he
had taken, the story of the chartering of the <i>Columbian</i>,
and the young millionaire's sudden departure on a
Southern cruise was in the next morning's papers.  Jack
silently cursed the yacht-broker.
</p>

<p>
He had no more than read the story, he was still
lingering over his breakfast, when the telephone in the
Dutch room rang, and the voice on the wire said:
</p>

<p>
"Miss Culbreth is asking for you."
</p>

<p>
"What!" cried Jack.  "You mean she's downstairs!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You're sure it's me she wants?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, Mr. Robinson," she said.
</p>

<p>
Jack hesitated before answering.  To tell the truth
his courage sunk slowly into his boots.  He would
sooner have faced five strong men than the infuriated
Miriam.  But as soon as he realized he was afraid
his obstinacy came into play.  He said to himself: "I'm
not going to let her bluff me."  Aloud he said curtly:
"Show her up."
</p>

<p>
Although she must have set out from home in a
rage, Miriam had not on that account neglected her
appearance.  She wore a little red hat with a cunning
flare to the brim, and was otherwise all in black.  Her
fine eyes were dark with anger.
</p>

<p>
"By the Lord she's beautiful!" thought Jack.  "It's
all very well for Kate to talk, but there's a dangerous
delight in fighting a woman like this!"
</p>

<p>
She lost no time coming to the point.  "Is this story
in the papers about Bobo true?" she demanded, declining
to sit.
</p>

<p>
"More or less," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by that?  Has he gone away?"
</p>

<p>
"Just a little trip for his health."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe you!"
</p>

<p>
"Then why ask?"
</p>

<p>
"You've had him kidnapped!"
</p>

<p>
"Ahead of you, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Spare me your impudence, please!"
</p>

<p>
Jack bowed low.
</p>

<p>
"I'll expose you in the newspapers!" she threatened
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead!  You may be sure I know exactly what
I'm doing."
</p>

<p>
His coolness made her pause.  She stared at him
stormily for a moment "Maybe it's not true!" she
said.  "Maybe you gave out the story yourself to put
me off."
</p>

<p>
Jack smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I'll see!" she cried.  She darted into the adjoining
room, Bobo's bedroom.
</p>

<p>
Jack let her go.  There was nothing in any of the
rooms that it mattered if she saw.  He heard her
opening and slamming the doors, and sat down to his
interrupted breakfast.  He could see that his cool airs
maddened her, and there was a kind of breathless fun
in it.  He was less cool than he appeared.  His heart
hammered on his ribs.
</p>

<p>
She came running back angrier if possible than
before.  Jack affected to be very much absorbed in an
item in the newspaper, which he relinquished with
manifest reluctance to rise at her entrance.
</p>

<p>
"Well, did you find his corpse?"
</p>

<p>
Miriam's only reply was an inarticulate sound of
rage.  It was some moments before she could command
herself sufficiently to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Just you wait!  I'll get square!  I'll beat you yet!"
</p>

<p>
She turned to go.
</p>

<p>
Jack suddenly bethought himself that Kate had
advised him to make friends with Miriam.  Just how
far he was moved by a disinterested desire to further
his case, and how far by Miriam's angry beauty, it
would be well, perhaps, not to inquire.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go," he said.
</p>

<p>
She hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be bound you rushed away from home without
any breakfast.  Have some of mine."
</p>

<p>
Apparently the wisdom of resuming diplomatic
relations must have occurred to her too, for she looked
over her shoulder with a slow smile.  Her eyes were
still dangerous.
</p>

<p>
"Come and sit down," said Jack.  "I'll make fresh
coffee on the machine."
</p>

<p>
She swayed towards the table with inimitable nonchalance.
Sitting, she gave Jack an inscrutable glance
of the strange eyes, and languidly pulled off her gloves.
</p>

<p>
"By George!  You're good to look at!" he said
impulsively.  It was surprised out of him.
</p>

<p>
"So are you," she murmured, with a languorous look
through her lashes.
</p>

<p>
It was exactly the wrong thing for her to say; but
Miriam persistently misread Jack.  So long as she
defied him and abused him he was profoundly stirred;
he longed to seize and tame her.  But when she
displayed a disposition to woo him, he suddenly chilled
and drew back.  He did not let her see it of course.
To create a diversion he jumped up to attend to the
coffee machine.
</p>

<p>
"Silly for us to quarrel," she said, when he returned
to the table.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, isn't it?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Our real interests lie together.  If we go on fighting
each other, we'll spoil both our games."
</p>

<p>
It just suited Jack to play up to this idea of their
respective positions.  "You're right," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I offered before to join with you," she said.
</p>

<p>
"But you have me at a disadvantage," objected Jack.
"If you marry Bobo you'll have a legal hold over him.
Where will I and my job be then?  You as good as
told me you'd kick me out."
</p>

<p>
"That was when I was angry," she said blandly.
"What a woman says when she's angry doesn't count."
</p>

<p>
"But you might get angry again," suggested Jack
dryly.
</p>

<p>
She favored him with a slow intoxicating glance of
the hazel eyes.  "You fool!" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't you see?"
</p>

<p>
"See what?"
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't really refuse you anything."
</p>

<p>
Jack was sorry now that he had asked her to stay.
He saw the situation approaching from which no man
can extricate himself with dignity and self-respect
entire.  But he was not sure that he wished to extricate
himself.  In his confusion he chose the worst possible
course: that is, to laugh it off.
</p>

<p>
"That's good!  Five minutes ago you hated me like
a rattlesnake!"
</p>

<p>
"What's the difference?" she murmured.  "I hate
you because&mdash;because you treat me so.  When I&mdash;Oh,
why do you make me say it!"
</p>

<p>
She was breathing quickly and her eyes were large
and bright.  Jack wondered how much of this feeling
was real, and how much art.  But no man wants to
disbelieve a woman when she intimates that she loves
him.
</p>

<p>
She suddenly leaned across the table, and took his
hand between both of hers.  Her proud head was
lowered in an affecting way.  "Love&mdash;!  Hate&mdash;!"
she murmured brokenly.  "What's the difference?  You
drive me wild with your cool airs, your indifference!
Sometimes I could kill you!  But&mdash;but I wouldn't want
you any different either.  I want you to master me!"
</p>

<p>
It was a heady draught.  Jack's brain reeled.
</p>

<p>
She raised her head.  Her eyes were embers in the
wind.  "Look at me!  Am I not beautiful?  You said
I was beautiful!"
</p>

<p>
The voice of the tempter whispered to Jack: "Take
her at her word.  She deserves no consideration.  Kate
would have no right to blame you after what she
said."
</p>

<p>
"Look in my eyes," she whispered.  "What do you
see there?"
</p>

<p>
The fire of those strange eyes lighted a train of
gunpowder in the man.  He forgot everything.
"Oh&mdash;you beauty!" he murmured hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
They rose simultaneously and leaned towards each
other over the little table.
</p>

<p>
"It's all so simple," she whispered.  "Let me marry
Bobo.  You will still be his master and mine!"
</p>

<p>
Once more she fatally overreached herself.  Every
instinct of decency in the man was revolted by the
picture she called up.  He firmly unwound the white arms
that had crept around his neck.  He turned away and
took a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
Miriam stared at him frightened and angry.
"What's the matter with you?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better go," he said harshly.
</p>

<p>
She went to him swiftly.  "You can't deny me!  You
love me!  I saw it in your eyes.  Why do you fight
against me?  Look at me.  I could be everything to
you!"
</p>

<p>
"Love!" said Jack with a grim laugh.  "You're
wasting your time now!  You almost had me&mdash;but you
let me peep too far under the lid.  Never again!
You're too good a hater.  I want to keep a whole
skin!"
</p>

<p>
She saw then that she had indeed failed.  The
humiliation was intolerable.  She burst into angry tears.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I hate you!  I hate you!" she cried.  "I <i>will</i>
kill you if you don't keep out of my way!"
</p>

<p>
She ran out of the room.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
The <i>Columbian</i> set sail early on a Friday
morning.  On Monday Jack received the following
telegram:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Charleston, S.C.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Came in here last night for coal.  At daylight sick
man discovered to be missing.  Must have climbed
through port hole and dropped into waiting boat.
Wireless operator gone too.  Captain thinks he was
bribed by wireless to liberate B.  Have discovered that
the two of them took the Southern train North late last
night.  Wire instructions.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Lizzie Regan.</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Jack thought swiftly: "Late train North from
Charleston last night.  That would bring them here
late to-night.  Bobo would telegraph Miriam of course.
She may go to meet him."
</p>

<p>
He jumped to the telephone, and calling up the
Bienvenu, got Starr on the wire.
</p>

<p>
"This is Robinson&mdash;at the Hotel Madagascar, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mr. Robinson?"
</p>

<p>
"Is Miss Culbreth still in your hotel?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, but she's leaving.  She just telephoned
down for her bill to be made out."
</p>

<p>
"Could you arrange to have her followed when she
leaves?"
</p>

<p>
"Yet, sir, I have a smart boy here who can be
depended on."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  If she goes to the Pennsylvania station
that's all right.  I will be there.  But if she goes
elsewhere have a message telephoned to this hotel for
me."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir.  I will see to it."
</p>

<p>
Jack hastened into Kate's house and assumed the
Pitman make-up.  It had outlived its usefulness so far
as the old man was concerned, but he had no reason
to suppose that he had ever been pointed out to
Miriam in that character.  At any rate he had no other
disguise handy.  With a brief good-by to Kate he
taxied to the Pennsylvania terminal.  All travelers to
the South use this station.
</p>

<p>
Miriam was already there, walking impatiently up
and down the concourse.  She was heavily veiled, but
even so was a sufficiently notable figure.  Jack was
beginning to be acquainted with her wardrobe,
extensive as that was.  To-day she was wearing a green
hat and black furs that he had seen before.
</p>

<p>
When the gates were opened for the 10:08 Washington
express she went through.  Jack bought a ticket
for Washington and followed.  Supposing that she
would ride in a parlor car, he got in a coach, as he did
not care to subject Mr. Pitman's disguise to a five
hours' scrutiny on the train.
</p>

<p>
After the train had started, he showed his police
credentials to the conductor, and describing Miriam,
asked to be informed to what point her ticket had
been taken.  Word was brought him later that it was
to Baltimore.  He asked to be told if she got off before
that.
</p>

<p>
But Miriam apparently had no suspicion that she
was being followed.  In Baltimore she went openly to
the Hotel Warwick and registered under own name&mdash;or
rather, under the name that Jack knew her by.
The so-called Mr. Pitman was close behind her.
</p>

<p>
After putting her bag in her room she reappeared
unveiled, and started to walk downtown at a leisurely
pace, Mr. Pitman still in unsuspected attendance.  He
heard her ask a policeman the way to the City Hall.
In that building she asked at the Information desk
where marriage licenses were to be procured.
</p>

<p>
Jack smiled to himself.  "License number two!" he
thought.  He did not risk discovery by following her
through the unfrequented corridors, but waited within
watch of the main entrance for her to reappear.
</p>

<p>
For the next hour Miriam killed time in Charles
Street, the fashionable shopping thoroughfare.  She
visited several hat shops, and presumably "tried
on."  Mr. Pitman could not very well follow her into such
places.  Later a tea room held her for another half
hour.  At some time during these peregrinations she
must have become aware that she was being followed.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the tea room she hailed a taxi, and ordered
the chauffeur to take her to the Hotel Minnert.  Jack
followed in another cab.  When he saw that the hotel
was only around the corner, he began to suspect a ruse.
She entered by the Ladies' door, and he was less than
half a minute behind her.  She was not visible inside.
From the doorman he learned that she had walked
upstairs.  He followed.
</p>

<p>
On the next floor there were no public rooms but
only endless corridors with bedrooms opening off.
There was not a soul in sight and he hesitated which
way to turn.  Finally a chambermaid appeared around
a corner, and a piece of silver procured him information.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, she just went down the corridor on the
right.  She asked me if there was another stairs, and I
told her yes, at the end of that corridor."
</p>

<p>
Jack hastened in the direction named.  At the foot
of the rear stairs he found a door giving on a quiet
back street.  The door-keeper supplied the next link
of information.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, there was a taxi waiting for her.  She just
drove away."
</p>

<p>
"Hm!" thought Jack ruefully, "that's a good one
on me!  Either she knows this place of old, or else she
fixed it up on the way with the taxi-driver."
</p>

<p>
He was not greatly concerned by this mishap, for he
knew the time the Southern train was due to arrive
in Baltimore, and he expected to meet her again there.
The time was six-thirty.  He spent the interim in
buying himself an overcoat of striking cut, and a tweed
hat that would pull down low on his head.  These
articles changed his appearance not a little.  On the
way uptown he stopped in at the Warwick, but Miriam
had not returned there.
</p>

<p>
When he got to the station Miriam was not to be
seen among the crowd.  The train was forty-five
minutes late.  Informing himself as to which gate the
passengers would be discharged through, he took a
seat commanding it, and affected to busy himself with
a magazine.
</p>

<p>
As the time for the coming of the train drew near,
and no Miriam showed up, a sharp anxiety attacked
him.  He wondered if he could have erred in his
calculations.  He knew she had not had time since he lost
her, to telegraph down the line for Bobo to get off at
Washington.
</p>

<p>
The train drew in, and the passengers began mounting
the steps.  Still no sign of Miriam.  But suddenly
Jack caught sight of Bobo among the passengers and
his spirits rebounded.
</p>

<p>
"Is she going to let me carry him off?" he wondered.
</p>

<p>
The wireless operator accompanied Bobo, and Bobo
was clad in one of his uniforms.  As there was about
thirty pounds difference in weight between the two&mdash;in
Bobo's favor, the plump youth cut rather a comic
figure, and was acutely conscious of the fact.
</p>

<p>
As they reached the top of the stairs, a lady clad
in deep mourning with a thick black veil concealing
her whole head and face stepped forward and laid
her hand on Bobo's arm.  At first Bobo shrank back
from this sable apparition, but she pushed the veil
aside sufficiently for him to see her face, and he grinned
from ear to ear.
</p>

<p>
"You fool!" said Jack to himself.  "Not to have
seen through that!"
</p>

<p>
Miriam and the two young men went quickly down
the way to the side entrance of the station.  Jack
was not far behind them.  In that confusion of people
there was little danger of their spotting him.  Outside
among the waiting automobiles was a big Macklin
touring car, and Miriam led the two men towards it.
Jack swore at himself again.
</p>

<p>
"She had the wit to hire a special car, while you have
to trust to a taxi!"
</p>

<p>
He jumped in a taxi.  "Follow that Macklin car
that's just turning out," he said.  "Ten dollars bonus,
if you stick to it."
</p>

<p>
The touring car did not turn South towards the
center of town, but headed North by the bridge over
the railway tracks.  At the first wide street, North
avenue, Jack read on the street lamps, it turned East,
then North again on another wide thoroughfare which
finally brought them out into the country.
</p>

<p>
"Double fare outside the City limits," the chauffeur
said laconically.
</p>

<p>
"Let her go," said Jack.  "I'm good for it."
</p>

<p>
A short turn through a lane brought them to
another main highway.
</p>

<p>
"Belair Road," said the chauffeur, "main road to
the North."
</p>

<p>
"Have you a full tank?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Follow them to New York then if necessary!"
</p>

<p>
On this dark road the occupants of the touring car
soon discovered that they were being followed.  They
put on speed.
</p>

<p>
"Give her all she'll take," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately the taxi was of a good make, and the
engine was tight and clean.  The little car gave a good
account of itself.  Moreover the road was smoothly
paved, which further helped equalize the chances of
light car and heavy one.  Pursued and pursuer roared
down the dark highway with cut-outs open.  For several
miles the way lay over one steep hill after another.
They precipitated themselves recklessly down each
declivity, gaining a momentum at the bottom that carried
them almost to the top again without slackening.
</p>

<p>
"This is faster than I'm allowed to run her," said
Jack's chauffeur.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right.  I'll be responsible for the damage."
</p>

<p>
The man grinned and stepped a little harder on his
accelerator.
</p>

<p>
At first the big Macklin car set up a pace they were
unable to match, but apparently the driver was
unfamiliar with the road, and after he had narrowly
escaped flinging his car in the ditch on several sharp
turns, he was compelled to slow down somewhat.  This
gave them an even chance.  They kept about a hundred
feet behind the red eye of the tail-light ahead.
</p>

<p>
"We're holding them all right," said Jack's chauffeur.
</p>

<p>
The words were scarcely out of his mouth when there
came a report like a small field piece beneath them.
</p>

<p>
"Damn that tire!" cried the man.
</p>

<p>
"There goes Bobo's last chance of salvation!" said
Jack.
</p>

<p>
The blow-out had been heard in the car ahead.
They swept out of sight around a bend tooting their
horn triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
It took them the usual half an hour to change tires.
</p>

<p>
"Back to town I suppose," said the driver when
he was ready to start again.
</p>

<p>
"No!" said Jack.  "They might blow up a tire,
too.  Keep on!"
</p>

<p>
In a village called Kingsville they stopped long
enough to make sure that the Macklin car was still
ahead of them.  At the next place, Belair, they came
upon it resting demurely in front of a dwelling.  Since
there was a church next door, it was not difficult to
guess that this house was a parsonage.
</p>

<p>
"I thought so," said Jack grimly.
</p>

<p>
He jumped out and rang the bell.  When the door
was opened by a maid there was no need for him to
make any inquiry.  Through an open archway he could
see into the living-room of the house.  Bobo and
Miriam were standing hand in hand before the parson
with his book.  Even as Jack looked, he finished
pronouncing the benediction, and the couple turned around.
Miriam had evidently left her woeful headgear in the
car outside.  She was wearing the dashing green hat
again.
</p>

<p>
Jack, forgetting for the moment that he was
disguised, stepped into the room.  Bobo did not know
him, but Miriam did.  Her face lighted up with a
wicked triumph.
</p>

<p>
"What a pity you were late!" she said with mocking
sweetness, "I would so much have liked you to be
present!"
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;who&mdash;who's this?" stammered Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"This is Jack.  All dressed up!  Don't you recognize
his beautiful eyes?"
</p>

<p>
Bobo saw that it was Jack, turned pale, and looked
furtively about him for a way out, in case things went
suddenly against him.
</p>

<p>
"Be the first to congratulate me," said Miriam to
Jack.  "Most of all I want to hear it from you."
</p>

<p>
Poor Bobo in his skin-tight uniform was an absurd
figure of a bridegroom.  With humble eyes, he was
mutely imploring Jack not to give him away.
</p>

<p>
Jack had no intention of doing so.  Knowing himself
to be the real master of the situation, he could
well afford to put up with the girl's outrageous
triumphant air.
</p>

<p>
Jack's smile irritated her.  She lost her joyful look.
The commoner aspect of her broke through.  "I'm
Mrs. Norman," she said with a disagreeable laugh.
She displayed her wedding-ring.  "You can't get around
that!  Remember it, the next time you start out to
get the better of me."
</p>

<p>
"Miriam, for God's sake, don't provoke him!"
whispered poor Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Provoke him!" she said, raising her voice.  "You
seem strangely afraid of hurting the feelings of your
secretary.  He needs to be provoked.  He's too big
for his shoes!  Let him understand that I'm the
mistress now, and his chance of keeping his job depends
on his pleasing me!"
</p>

<p>
Bobo almost fainted.
</p>

<p>
Jack met her eyes squarely.  "All right, my lady!"
he was thinking.  "My turn will come later!"  He
foresaw that his game in the future would be furthered
if he appeared to submit.  So he bowed&mdash;but he could
not quite iron out the mocking smile.
</p>

<p>
"I only aim to please!" said he.
</p>

<p>
Miriam looked at him suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"What do you wish me to do, Mr. Norman?" he
asked Bobo.
</p>

<p>
To that youth it was like a ray of light breaking
through.  He lifted his eyes to Jack with a kind of
sheeplike gratitude.  But he seemed incapable of
speech.
</p>

<p>
Miriam answered for him.  "Go back to New York,
and wait for us at the Madagascar."
</p>

<p>
Jack bowed again, and returned to his taxi.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap29"></a></p>

<h3>
29
</h3>

<p>
Jack returned to New York on the night train.  At
the hotel he found a message from Starr of the
Bienvenu Hotel reading:
</p>

<p>
"A.D.T. boy 791 came with a package for Miss
Culbreth to-day.  When he was told she was out of
town he took it back with him."
</p>

<p>
Jack's police credentials smoothed the way for him
with the A.D.T. officials, and within two hours of
the time he received the message, No. 791, otherwise
Tommy Mullulus, was on his way to the Madagascar
to be questioned.
</p>

<p>
He was a small, thin boy with a wary eye that testified
to a wide experience of the world, and an insinuating
grin that was still childlike.  His meager limbs
were lost in his faded, flapping trousers, but he had a
doughty air far beyond his years.  His official age
was fifteen; had he not to swear to that to get his
"working papers"?  But actually he was about two
years short of it.
</p>

<p>
He was disposed to be evasive in answering Jack's
questions.
</p>

<p>
"You brought a package to the Hotel Bienvenu yesterday?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Where did you get it?"
</p>

<p>
"At the office.  Fella at the desk handed it to me."
</p>

<p>
"That means it was brought into the office by the
person who wanted it delivered?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess so."
</p>

<p>
"Where is your office?"
</p>

<p>
"1118 Broadway."
</p>

<p>
"Did you see the person that brought the package
in?"
</p>

<p>
"Didn't take no particular notice."
</p>

<p>
"Well, was it a man or a woman?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't rightly look."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it a fact when you boys are waiting for a call,
that you size up everybody that comes in to see what
kind of a job you're going to get, and what's likely
to be in it?"
</p>

<p>
"We gen'ally does," said Tommy with an innocent
air, "but Fat Harris was pushin' me on the bench, and
I was pushin' him back, so I didn't take no notice of
who come in."
</p>

<p>
It suggested itself to Jack that the boy was under
the spell of a generous tip.  To offer him a larger tip
was the most obvious course, but Jack, knowing
something about boys, hesitated.  Tommy would take the
money, of course, but it would probably make him
suspicious, and therefore more secretive than before.
A better way was to win his confidence if it could be
done.
</p>

<p>
"Tommy," said Jack, "the guy that gave you that
package is a crook, and I'm trying to land him, see?"
</p>

<p>
Tommy looked interested but wary.  He required
to be shown.
</p>

<p>
"Did they tell you at the office who I was?" asked
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"No more than your name was Robinson."
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever hear of John Farrow Norman?"
</p>

<p>
"The poor boy that came in for a hundred million!
You bet!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I work for him.  I'm his secretary."
</p>

<p>
A noiseless whistle escaped through Tommy's lips.
But he still looked a little incredulous.
</p>

<p>
"You can find that out at the office on your way
out," suggested Jack.
</p>

<p>
Tommy looked impressed by this evidence of good
faith.  "Say, boss, can I see him himself&mdash;Norman I
mean?"
</p>

<p>
"He's out of town to-day.  But you'll see him all
the time if you work for me."
</p>

<p>
Tommy was melting fast.  "On the level, do you
want me to work for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Surest thing you know!"
</p>

<p>
"What doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, just a little detective work," said Jack carelessly.
</p>

<p>
Tommy was won.  "Oh-h!  Detective work!  That's
my specialty!"
</p>

<p>
"The man who sent that package to the Bienvenu
Hotel is trying to blackmail Mr. Norman," said Jack.
"We've got to catch him with the goods."
</p>

<p>
Tommy nodded sagely.
</p>

<p>
"See if you can't remember what he looked like.
Was he a middle-aged man short and thickset,
well-dressed, but not sporty, heavy white moustache, and
little chin whisker?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure!" cried Tommy.  "That's the very guy!  I
remember now."
</p>

<p>
"Well, give me some further particulars then," said
Jack to test him.
</p>

<p>
Tommy considered.  "His hair was brushed in a
funny way, sticking out like, in front of his ears."
</p>

<p>
"That's our man!" said Jack.  "Has he ever been
in your office before?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, once in a while.  He's a guy you'd remember.
Gives big tips."
</p>

<p>
"When you couldn't deliver that package at the
Bienvenu what did you do with it?"
</p>

<p>
"Handed it in at the office again."
</p>

<p>
"Then what happened to it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's there yet.  They couldn't return it to sender
because he didn't leave no address."
</p>

<p>
"You're sure he hasn't been after it himself?"
</p>

<p>
"Not up to the time I left.  Us boys watches for
that guy."
</p>

<p>
"Thought you said you couldn't remember him."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I didn't know which side was on the square
then," said Tommy unabashed.
</p>

<p>
"Good!  I'm sure he will come after it, and I want
you to go back to the office and watch for him.  When
he does come in, see if you're clever enough to trail
him back to his home or his office, or wherever it is
he goes, see?"
</p>

<p>
"How can I sneak out without orders from the
desk?" objected Tommy.  "And supposin' I'm out on
another call when he comes in?"
</p>

<p>
"You can leave that to me," said Jack.  "From now
on you're working for me, and you won't take any
other calls, see?  I'll have an order sent through from
the head office to your branch.  But mind you, not a
word to any of the other kids!"
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, boss," said the diminutive sleuth
with dignity.  "I know a thing or two about this biz.
I can easy stall off those pore fish down there."
</p>

<p>
"Here's something on account," said Jack offering
him a dollar bill.  "As to your final payment I'll just
say this: if you and I pull this off together, I'll offer
you a permanent job with Mr. Norman."
</p>

<p>
"Me workin' for Norman himself!  Gee!" said Tommy.
</p>

<p>
A few hours later the bridal couple turned up at
the Madagascar.  Miriam was beautiful and
beautifully dressed, but feeling sure of her position
now, she made no attempt to curb her arrogance.  She
believed that she owned the Madagascar and acted
accordingly.  The hotel servants cringed&mdash;and detested
her.  Bobo was correspondingly depressed and
anxious-looking.
</p>

<p>
Their unannounced arrival hardly surprised Jack.
He was in expectation of a call for funds.
</p>

<p>
Miriam immediately demanded to be shown through
the suite.  "So that I can choose which rooms I will
take."
</p>

<p>
Jack, amused by the comedy, accompanied her and
Bobo on the tour of inspection.  Jack's room, the next
room but one to the Dutch room, seemed to please her
most.  Perhaps it was because she knew it was Jack's
room.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take this for my bedroom," she said, "but the
furniture is ghastly.  It will have to be completely done
over.  Bobo's room shall be my boudoir."
</p>

<p>
Bobo glanced anxiously at Jack.  "You can have my
room of course," he said quickly.  "But this is Jack's
room."
</p>

<p>
It seemed as if she had just been lying in wait for
him to say something like this.  She whirled on him.
"Well, and am I supposed to give way to your secretary?
If you're willing to give up the best rooms to
the servants I'm not!"
</p>

<p>
"Miriam is right," said Jack.  "I'll move into the
two little rooms at the back; Silas Gyde's old suite."
</p>

<p>
"Hereafter please address me as Mrs. Norman,"
said Miriam haughtily.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Mrs. Norman," said Jack demurely.  To
himself he added: "Oh, lady, lady, it's a shame to let
you in so bad!  When the truth come out the shock
will surely kill you!"
</p>

<p>
"And while we are away," added Miriam, "go to a
first class decorator, and arrange to have my two
rooms done.  I will have the boudoir hung in pale
yellow silk brocade, and the bedroom in a softer
material, pink.  Samples can be sent me."
</p>

<p>
Jack bowed.  "You're going away again?" he asked
politely.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, Bobo just came in to get some money."
</p>

<p>
Bobo bent an imploring glance on him.
</p>

<p>
Jack had his things carried into the back rooms, and
put all in order there.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!  I can escape the sound of her voice!"
he said to himself.  "Where, oh where is that sweet
murmur with which she used to woo us!  Bobo's
awakening has come even sooner than I expected.  She
might have given him a few days' run for his money.
What a story this will make to tell Kate later.  But
the poor fat kid is in such a deuce of a hole it really
spoils the comedy!"
</p>

<p>
Presently Bobo applied at the door of Jack's sitting-room
with a pitiful hang-dog air.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!" said Jack cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
Bobo shambled in, and flung himself in a chair.
"Don't bawl me out!" he said beseechingly.  "I'm just
about all in!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to say much," returned Jack.  "But
I'm only human.  You can't expect me to keep my
mouth shut altogether."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I were dead!" said Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Cheer up, the worst is yet to come!  There's good
comedy in it, I assure you.  I'll give you a piece of
good advice if you like."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, when a wife takes that highty-tighty tone
towards her husband they say there's only one remedy."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Corporal punishment," said Jack, grinning.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?" said Bobo, staring.
</p>

<p>
"I believe the English law allows a man a rod no
thicker than his thumb for the purpose of maintaining
domestic discipline."
</p>

<p>
Bobo refused to see the joke.  He sat in silence
with his chin on his breast.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you're waiting for money," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Bobo nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to rub it in, but I'm curious to know
if you appreciate the colossal cheek of your coming
to me for money after what has happened?"
</p>

<p>
Bobo nodded again.  "What else could I do?"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't be surprised if part of it was actually
for the purpose of settling with the man who helped
you to disobey my orders."
</p>

<p>
"Miriam fixed that up by wireless."
</p>

<p>
"Then I might suggest that it's up to her to settle
with the man.  You told me Miriam was well-fixed,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"Something has happened," said Bobo.  "We went
to the Bienvenu before coming here.  Some one called
her up there.  She wouldn't let me hear what she said.
She was sore afterwards.  Seems her income is cut
off or something."
</p>

<p>
"That's not hard to guess," said Jack.  "The old
man told her that now she's got you, she can afford
to dispense with his weekly contribution."
</p>

<p>
"Do you really think she's in his pay?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let's don't go into that again."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!  What will become of me!" groaned
Bobo.  "I've got to show her the color of my money,
or she'll worm the truth out of me!"
</p>

<p>
"You'll never tell her the truth.  She'd kill you."
</p>

<p>
"She'll guess the truth, if I don't keep her supplied!"
</p>

<p>
"You should have thought of that yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be so hard on me!" whined Bobo.  "What's
the money to you!"
</p>

<p>
Jack felt slightly disgusted.  "I'm going to keep you
supplied," he said, "within reason.  But you'll have to
keep that young lady inside the limits that I set.  I've
no intention of maintaining her like the Queen of
Sheba.  Tell her your money's in the hands of trustees.
Tell her anything you like."
</p>

<p>
"How much?" said Bobo anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Five thousand for the honeymoon.  After that a
thousand weekly.  Not another cent."
</p>

<p>
"I've got to have the limousine," whined Bobo.
</p>

<p>
Jack's lip curled.  "You're not exactly in a position to
make demands.  However, you can have the car.  It's
no good to me."
</p>

<p>
Bobo commenced to stammer his thanks.
</p>

<p>
"Cut it out!" said Jack.  "I'm only doing it, because
it happens to suit my plans.  You have disobeyed my
orders, and forfeited all claims on me.  I reserve the
right of course, to show you up whenever it suits me."
</p>

<p>
Bobo lived in the present.  Seeing his immediate
needs relieved, he refused to consider the unpleasant
future.  His eye brightened as Jack went to write him a
check.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap31"></a></p>

<h3>
31
</h3>

<p>
This was the night of the weekly meeting of the
Friends of Freedom, Barbarossa's circle, of
which Jack was now a full member.  On his way to the
meeting-place he stopped in at Harmon Evers' place
according to custom, to be metamorphosed from Jack
Robinson into Henry Cassels, the wild-haired young
anarchist.
</p>

<p>
Jack enjoyed these visits to the wig-maker.  Evers
was an original.  His philosophy never failed him&mdash;nor
his common-sense.  He was so conspicuous for the
latter quality that Jack more than once had been
tempted to confide in him fully, with the idea of
profiting by his advice.  It was only the general rule he had
laid down for himself, not to tell a soul of his affairs,
that had restrained him.  As it was, he and Evers had
talked over the situation in hypothetical terms.  Evers
never allowed himself to betray a vulgar curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Evers' wit and wisdom were usually expressed in
terms of hair.  His special knowledge was astonishing.
He could tell you offhand the style of hairdressing
favored by a great man at any stage of his career, and
drew ingenious parallels between his hair and his
policy.  Napoleon's downfall he ascribed to the atrophy
of his follicles.
</p>

<p>
As it was after shop-hours the work was done in
Evers' apartment up-stairs, a model of neatness and
comfort.  Clearly Mrs. Evers' past triumphs on the
boards had not unfitted her for the soberer business
of housekeeping.  Though they showed every evidence
of being well-to-do they kept no servant.
</p>

<p>
"So to-night is lodge-night," said Evers facetiously,
as he worked over Jack's hair.  "Odd isn't it, how
grown men love to club together and surround
themselves with all manner of solemn nonsense.  The
original lodges were in the African jungle.  The high
officers in secret societies are nearly always bald.  Yet
hair plays a large part in many rituals.  Consider the
goat!"
</p>

<p>
"This is not exactly a lodge that I belong to," said
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"I understand," said Evers.  "That was just my
little joke.  I guess the risks you take, my young friend,
and I admire your courage.  You have the hair of a
brave man.  I am always delighted when you return to
me in safety to have the make-up removed.  It is a
valuable work you are engaged on, too.  These people
are the weeds of our fertile soil; they should be rooted
up."
</p>

<p>
"As to rooting them up I leave that to the police,"
said Jack carelessly.  "I have a special object in view.
There are worse things in the world than a lot of
spouting anarchists."
</p>

<p>
"What could be worse?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, murder as a business proposition."
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens!  Can such things be possible!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The meeting-place of the Friends of Freedom was
very ingeniously contrived.  You entered by the front
door of a big double-decker tenement on Orchard
street.  So many people came and went by this door,
that the arrival of the Reds singly and in couples was
entirely unnoticed.  You passed through the hall of
the double-decker into a narrow paved court where a
smaller rear tenement faced you.
</p>

<p>
Entering the latter building, you gave the password
at a door on the left of the hall, and assembled with
your fellow-members in a large bare room.  But this
was not the meeting-place.  When all were present,
and the scrutineers were satisfied, that all had a right
to be present, the hall door was locked, a trap in the
floor was lifted, and all present silently descended into
the cellar.  The last man let the trap fall behind
him.
</p>

<p>
Though damp and moldy-smelling, the place was otherwise
admirably fitted for its purpose.  The walls were
of thick rough stone without any openings.  A special
ceiling had been constructed to keep sounds from rising.
In such a vault the speakers could shout themselves
hoarse without any danger of giving anything away to
the outside world.  It is no easy task to find a safe
meeting-place for anarchists.  In this case the landlord was
a member of the circle.
</p>

<p>
There was another stairway at the rear by which
Barbarossa alone was privileged to enter.  Jack
understood that this stair led to a room in an adjoining
house, whence you could gain the next street.  It
provided a means of escape in case of a surprise from
the police.
</p>

<p>
It was a wild-looking crowd that gathered in the cellar.
They specialized in original hirsute effects.  Evers
the wig-maker could have obtained many new ideas
there.  But Jack had not attended many meetings
before he began to suspect that their wildness did not
extend much further than hair.  They were noisy, but
not particularly dangerous.  They seemed to Jack like a
parcel of children making believe to be enemies of
society.  Some of the younger men spoke with a genuine
fire, but they were generally squelched by their elders.
These elders stood as pat on their formulas as an old
guard Republican on his.
</p>

<p>
This was particularly true of Barbarossa their leader.
Anarchy was Barbarossa's meal-ticket, and he worked
it for all there was in it.  Barbarossa's superb red beard
and flaming aureole of hair were his principal stock
in trade.  He made a magnificent passionate figure on
the rostrum.  Every word he uttered was received as
gospel, for loyalty to him had become a tradition.  But
to Jack who came to the meetings with a cool brain,
Barbarossa's eloquence seemed a pumped-up affair.
</p>

<p>
To-night the proceedings were held up for ten
minutes by the tardy arrival of a member Jack had not seen
before, who had sent word in advance of his coming.
This was an important man, Jack was told, too busy to
attend every meeting.  He proved to be a man in his
forties, somewhat corpulent, with smooth jetty black
hair and small moustache and the clear, pallid skin that
goes with such hair.  Unlike the others he affected the
neat style of a business man.  He was addressed as
Comrade Wilde.
</p>

<p>
Jack apprehended a new quality in this man, a more
dangerous quality than in any of the others.  He
watched him closely.  Unfortunately the place was none
too well lighted.  Comrade Wilde held whispered
conferences with different members, but took no part in the
speechmaking.
</p>

<p>
Barbarossa harangued the gathering in fiery style on
the subject of the iniquities of the Federal Reserve
Banking system.  Comrade Rado then arose and
proposed that the New York branch be blown up as a
protest.  Barbarossa rebuked him for making such a
suggestion in open meeting.  It appeared there was a
committee to act on such matters.  Somebody said
something about a "Star Chamber" and a violent dispute
was engendered.  It was thus at every meeting.  Jack
suspected Barbarossa of purposely throwing the meeting
into disorder.  Acts of violence threatened his
livelihood.  Comrade Wilde listened to the uproar with an
ill-disguised sneer.
</p>

<p>
It was stilled by the speech of Comrade Berg, a mere
slip of a youth whom Jack had not noticed before.  He
rose with trembling hands and ecstatic eyes, and spoke
in a voice of soft intensity.  His subject was the necessity
of purifying themselves for the great sacrifice.  The
words were not extraordinary; it was the self-forgetfulness,
the strange half-insane passion of the speaker
that quieted the noisy, ordinary crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" thought Jack.  "This is the real thing!
This will bear watching."  Out of the corner of his
eyes he observed that Comrade Wilde was likewise
attending sharply to the youth.
</p>

<p>
His speech bore no relation to what had gone before.
He had reached such a state of exaltation as to be
unaware of what was going on around him.
</p>

<p>
"We must give up father, mother, dear ones, friends;
we must learn to do without love and affection; we must
cast out all that makes life sweet to live, so that when
the time comes to leave it there may be no unmanly
hanging back.  We must eat and drink no more than
enough to keep life in the body.  The world will never
be saved by guzzlers.  Gross eating obscures the finer
spirit of man.  In abstemiousness and solitude the true
inspiration comes.
</p>

<p>
"I am young.  I have no right to tell men older in
the Cause what to do.  I am speaking for myself only.
I lived alone until the message came to me.  I am ready
now to give all.  When you want an instrument I ask
you to use me first."
</p>

<p>
Barbarossa had been growing more and more uneasy.
He now interrupted the youth.  "One moment,
Comrade.  You are out of order.  There is some
unfinished business from the last meeting.  Afterwards
we will be glad to hear you.  The question that was
held over to be put to the vote at this meeting is: Shall
we take political action at the next election."
</p>

<p>
This was a favorite subject of controversy, and the
meeting was instantly convulsed again.  Berg sat down
dazed.  He was not allowed to speak again.
</p>

<p>
"Poor young devil!" thought Jack.  "Looks half
starved.  I'll ask him out to supper."
</p>

<p>
When they were completely talked out the meeting
broke up.  The comrades mounted the stairs in amity
all controversies forgotten.  With their bosoms
relieved of much perilous stuff, they yawned comfortably,
and began to think of supper.
</p>

<p>
Jack attached himself to young Berg as they gained
the street.  "Say, that was a great speech," he said by
way of ingratiating himself.
</p>

<p>
The youth pushed the lank hair out of his eyes and
looked at Jack wildly.  The light of incipient madness
was in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Poor devil!  Poor devil!" thought Jack.  The
sight hurt him.  Aloud he said: "Let's go and have a
bite of supper."
</p>

<p>
Berg shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, <i>come on</i>!" said Jack thrusting his arm through
the other youth's.
</p>

<p>
The tone of genuine friendliness must have reached
the cold breast.  Berg gave in without further
objection.
</p>

<p>
They entered one of the big bakery-restaurants on
Grand street, and ordered coffee and hamburgers.
The smell of cooking brought a faint color into Berg's
livid cheeks, and his nostrils dilated.
</p>

<p>
But the hamburgers were not destined to be eaten
by them.  When he had given the order Jack went
into a booth to telephone Evers not to wait up for him,
as he could lodge outside in his disguise and come in
to change in the morning.  Mrs. Evers took the
message.  When he came out of the booth Berg had
left their table.
</p>

<p>
"Where did my friend go?" Jack asked the waiter.
</p>

<p>
"I dunno.  Guy come in and spoke to him private,
and he took his hat and went with him."
</p>

<p>
"What kind of looking guy?"
</p>

<p>
"Fat.  Real black hair, black moustache, pale face.
Dressed neat.  Derby and black Melton overcoat."
</p>

<p>
This was a good description of Comrade Wilde.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Damn!" muttered Jack.
</p>

<p>
He put down the money for what he had ordered
and left the place.  He spent three hours wandering
about the East Side, looking into such places as were
still open, on the bare chance of running into his man.
All in vain of course.  Finally he sought out a cheap
lodging and threw himself down exhausted.  He was
tormented by the sense of an impending disaster.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap32"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
In the morning Jack called up the Madagascar to
see if there was any message for him.  It appeared
that some one had telephoned him several times since
the night before.  No name had been left, but the
telephone number was given.
</p>

<p>
The number suggested nothing to Jack.  He called
it, and a voice strange to him answered.  He asked if
there was anyone there who wished to speak to
Mr. Robinson, and after a pause he heard another voice,
a squeaky treble.
</p>

<p>
"This Mr. Robinson?  Gee!  I thought I'd never
get hold of you!"
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Whitcomb.  You know."
</p>

<p>
"Whitcomb?  I don't know," said Jack perplexed.
</p>

<p>
"You know, your confidential agent that you gave
orders to yesterday."
</p>

<p>
A light broke on Jack.  "Sure!" he cried.  "Didn't
recognize the name."
</p>

<p>
"Well you never know who may be tapping the
wire."
</p>

<p>
"Very wise precaution.  What is it, Tommy&mdash;I
mean Whitcomb?"
</p>

<p>
"I got a report to make."
</p>

<p>
"Fire away."
</p>

<p>
"Can't tell you over the phone.  It's too important.
Say, Mr. Robinson, I got what you sent me after all
right."
</p>

<p>
"Good boy!"
</p>

<p>
"Want me to come to the hotel?"
</p>

<p>
Jack not knowing if Bobo and Miriam would be
out of the way, said "No."  He considered a moment.
"Meet me at Harmon Evers' shop, number &mdash; East
Twenty-Ninth street.  In half an hour."
</p>

<p>
The half hour gave Jack time to get to Evers' and
change his make-up.  It was not yet eight o'clock.
</p>

<p>
Evers evinced a strong interest in Tommy when
he arrived.  "Comical little fellow, isn't he?" he said.
"That wiry, blonde hair betokens an enterprising
character.  These boys of the street learn to think for
themselves early."
</p>

<p>
Tommy and Jack did not discuss their business of
course, until they had left the shop.  Outside Jack
said:
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say you have spotted the house
where the old man lives?"
</p>

<p>
"Not where he lives, but where he changes his
clothes."
</p>

<p>
"Good man!  Where is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Forty-Eighth street, near Seventh avenue."
</p>

<p>
"We'll go there," said Jack, and looked up and
down for a taxi-cab.  "You can tell me the whole story
on the way.  We'll stop at the Madagascar for a gun
and a pair of handcuffs in case we meet our friend."
</p>

<p>
When they were seated in the cab Tommy began
his story.  "I was thinking over everything you told
me, and it seemed to me I wouldn't have a very good
show to trail the old man by myself.  Maybe he knew
my face you see, and anyway the uniform was a give
away.  So I got my cousin to help me.  He ain't
working now.  He's bigger'n me.  We're going partners in
the detective business when we get the coin to open
up an office."
</p>

<p>
"I described him the man I was after, and placed
him acrost the street from the office, with instructions
to follow me if I come up, and pick up the trail if I
had to drop it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, about half past two yes'day, old man come
into the office for his package all right.  Soon as I see
him I slides out and waits for him outside.  Say he was
cagy all right.  He had a hunch he was being trailed.
Dodged in one door of the Knickerbocker and out
again by another.  In the Forty-Second street building
he tried to shake me by riding in different elevators,
but I stuck to him all right.  Me cousin was right
there too, with his tongue hanging out."
</p>

<p>
"He took to the Subway next.  Got on an up-town
local at Grand Central.  I got in the next car because
I thought he might reco'nize me, but me cousin sits
down right opposite him.  Well after we left Times
Square station he comes into my car, gives me a hard
look, and sits down beside me.  Say, me heart was
going like a compressed air riveter."
</p>

<p>
"He says to me: 'Don't you work at 1118 Broadway?'
and I says: 'Yes, sir.'  He says: 'I guess you
worked for me sometimes,' and I looks at him hard
and makes out to reco'nize him for the first, and says:
'Yes, sir.'  He says: 'You carried a little package
for me up to the Hotel Beanvenoo yes'day.'  I says:
'Yes, sir.  The lady was out, so I brung it back.'"
</p>

<p>
"'Hm!' says he, like that, and looks at me real
hard for a minute, I guess.  He's got blue eyes that
make holes in you like bay'nits.  But he didn't get
any change off a me.  Then he says real sudden-like:
'Has anybody been trying to fix you?'  'Why no sir!'
I says with a baby stare.  'I dunno what you mean.'"
</p>

<p>
"'Where you going now?' says he.  I hadda say
somepin real quick.  I says: 'I gotta deliver a letter
up-town.'  'Where?'  'Seventy-Second street.'  He
says: 'Let me see it.'  I says: ''Gainst the rules,
boss.'  He laughs sneery like."
</p>

<p>
"By this time the train was pulling into Fiftieth.
'Well I get out here' he says, sticking me with those
eyes again.  And there he left me flat.  What could
I do.  But I look and I see me cousin is hep, so I know
all ain't lost yet.  As the train pulls out I see that kid
foller him up the stairs."
</p>

<p>
"Well I chases home, and changes me clo'es.  I puts
on the toughest rig I got.  Then I went down to Mis'
Harvest's store and waited 'round.  Mis' Harvest
keeps a little candy and stationery store under my
house.  Me cousin and me, we never plague her like
the other kids does, and she lets us sort of stick around.
We use her phone in our business.  We had agreed if
we got separated, the one who lost the trail was to
go to Mis' Harvest's and wait for a call."
</p>

<p>
"Me cousin calls me up about four o'clock.  He says
the old man is sitting in the Knickerbocker bar, drinking
and talking to a feller, and if I hustle maybe I can
git there before he leaves.  Well, I meets me cousin
outside the door of the bar, and he says the old man
is still inside.  He patrols the Broadway side, and I
takes the Forty-Second street entrance, and we meet
at the corner, and exchange signals.
</p>

<p>
"Bye and bye old man comes out my cousin's door,
and the two of us take after him down Broadway.  At
Fortieth street, old man turns real sudden and grabs
hold me cousin.  There was a cop there.  Old man
says: 'Officer, this boy has been follerin' me all
afternoon!'  Cop takes a grip on me cousin; say, maybe
that kid wasn't scared!  Cop says: 'What do you want
to annoy this gen'leman for?' but me cousin was mum
as a dummy!  Cop says: 'Do you want to lay 'a
complaint, sir?'  Old man says: 'Haven't time.  Just
warn him, and let him go.'  So the cop boots me cousin
down the side street, and old man goes on down Broadway.
But I was right there steppin' on his heels.  He
never thought of looking at me in me old clothes."
</p>

<p>
"Well now he thought he was clear of us all, and
he didn't bother about coverin' his tracks no more.
He crosses Broadway, and comes back tutter side.  He
only made one stop.  That was in a cigar store.  He
telephoned from the booth.  Then he led me straight to
the house on 48th near 7th, an old private house it
was, that's been turned into stores and offices.  There
was no elevator nor nothing.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't foller him inside, so I waits acrost the
street.  He come out in half an hour.  Say, I almost
missed him then.  He's a rapid change artist for fair!
Had a big trust on him now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Trust?" interrupted Jack.
</p>

<p>
"You know, corporation, bow-window&mdash;&mdash;" Tommy
illustrated.
</p>

<p>
"I see, go on."
</p>

<p>
"But he looked twenty years younger.  Real black
hair now, little black moustache, white face&mdash;like a
dude Eyetalian.  Had a neat derby on, and black
overcoat."
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" cried Jack.  "Comrade Wilde!
You're sure it was the same man."
</p>

<p>
"Certain sure!  But it was a peach of a make-up.
I wouldn't of got on to it, only he didn't walk like a
fat man.  He didn't lean back far enough to balance
his load if it was bona-fide."
</p>

<p>
"Pretty good!" said Jack.  "I never thought of that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I took after him again, but he give me the
slip at Sixth Avenue.  There was a car waiting for
him there&mdash;big black limousine&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know it!" said Jack ruefully.
</p>

<p>
"He hopped it, and went off down-town.  There was
a taxi there too, but the shover only laughed at me,
when I wanted to hire him.  By the time I satisfied
him I had the price, the black car was out of sight."
</p>

<p>
"I went back to the house on Forty-eighth.  There's
a lady's hat store in the basement, and a beauty parlor
on the first floor.  Up-stairs is mixed offices and
unfurnished rooms.  It's one of those old style walk-up
houses that you can go in and out of, without being
noticed.  I made out to be looking for a Mr. Webster.
By asking round I found out the old man has the third
floor rear.  There's no sign on the door nor nothing.
The other tenants thinks it's a traveler that just keeps
his samples there.  None of them don't know him."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap33"></a></p>

<h3>
33
</h3>

<p>
With a brief stop at the Madagascar for the
purpose mentioned, Jack and his diminutive
assistant were carried to the house on Forty-Eighth
street.  Tommy led the way to the third floor rear.
Above the parlor floor no changes had been made in
the old-fashioned residence, beyond letting a few panes
of glass in the door panels to light the hall.  But the
door Tommy indicated was of the original solid wood.
Jack knocked without receiving any answer.  There
was no sound of any movement within.
</p>

<p>
Jack had made up his mind that the boldest way of
entering would be the simplest.  He therefore sent
Tommy in search of a locksmith while he remained
silently on guard in the hall.  When the workman
appeared Jack explained that he had inadvertently
locked his keys in his room, and instructed him to pick
the lock.  When the man set to work, Jack privately
dispatched Tommy down into the yard to keep an eye
on the rear windows.
</p>

<p>
Opening the door was no great task.  Jack looked
inside with a fast beating heart.  His first general
impression was of a simply furnished office.  He
dismissed the locksmith, and recalled Tommy by a signal
from the window.
</p>

<p>
The principal object in the room was an old-fashioned
flat-topped desk so placed between the windows
that the light would fall over the user's shoulders.  The
desk was covered with papers, and the merest glance
was enough to show Jack that he had here the conclusive
evidence that he had been so long in search of.
He decided to call in official help now.  There was a
telephone on the desk, but he hesitated trusting his
secret to it.  Instead, he wrote a note to the Deputy
Commissioner, asking for two plain clothes men to be
sent him at once.  This he entrusted to Tommy,
instructing him to take a taxicab to police headquarters.
</p>

<p>
The door was fitted with a spring lock of the usual
pattern.  It had not been injured, and when the door
closed it locked itself.  As soon as he was left alone
Jack set about making a careful examination of the
place.  He figured that should the owner return, the
sound of the key in the lock would give him sufficient
warning.  He laid his automatic ready to his hand on
the desk.  He was careful to make no sound that
would warn any one who might stop to listen at the
door before entering.
</p>

<p>
First he took a general survey.  The two windows of
the room looked out on an array of back yards and
on the rear of a long row of similar buildings in the
next street.  One of the windows opened on a fire
escape.  At one's right as one faced the windows was
an old-fashioned fireplace: across the room were two
doors, the lower giving on the stair hall, the upper
presumably on the hall room adjoining.  The latter
door was screwed to its frame.
</p>

<p>
At the other end of the room from the windows was
a large closet.  Jack, fearful of being trapped by the
return of the owner merely looked in here.  It was set
out with a bureau and mirror, and from pegs around
the walls depended an extraordinary assortment of
clothes.  Jack saw that there was a complete separate
outfit on each peg; fine clothes and mean, native and
foreign; a policeman's uniform, and a complete
turn-out for a woman.  Above the pegs a shelf ran around,
and over each peg was a box which presumably contained
the smaller articles to complete each make-up.
</p>

<p>
Interesting as was this exhibit, the papers in connection
with the desk quickly drew Jack away from it.  Behind
the desk there was an object which whetted his
curiosity to the highest degree.  This was an oaken
cabinet with drawers of the kind that are used to
contain modern card index systems.  Jack eagerly pulled
out the top drawer.
</p>

<p>
Inside was a set of large cards, each headed by a
name in the usual manner, and with various particulars
as to that individual entered beneath.  As the scheme
became clear to him Jack's heart beat fast.  He could
scarcely credit the evidence of his senses.  It appeared
that he held in his hands a complete record of the
operations of "Mr. B."  What strange freak of vanity
could have led the criminal to collect such a mass of
damning evidence!
</p>

<p>
Here was one card chosen at random.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The story told by this card was typical.  Some of the
victims had required more pressure; some had given in
easier.  Some had fallen behind in their payments,
and had required to be "persuaded" anew.  Two of
the cards Jack turned over, those of Ames Benton and
Silas Gyde, were significantly underlined: "<i>Account
closed.</i>"  Jack shuddered.
</p>

<p>
From the card index he turned to the litter of papers
on the desk.  On top lay a typewritten communication
which bore neither address nor signature, but from the
contents was unmistakably to be identified as a report
from one of "Mr. B's" agents.  It read as follows:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I cannot give you any definite data as to X's movements
around his country place, because his habits are
very irregular.  He comes out from town sometimes
by motor, sometimes by train, and at any hour.  Sometimes
he stays up in the country for several days at a
time, transacting his business over a private telephone
wire.
</p>

<p>
"I understand he laughs at the idea of danger to
himself, and is averse to taking any special precautions.
I have learned though, that Mrs. X on her own
responsibility has engaged guards to patrol their place
very thoroughly.  It is well known that the Green
Hollow Club where he plays golf has long been guarded
by a small army under the guise of 'gardeners,'
'green-keepers,' etc.
</p>

<p>
"I have not been able to win the confidence of any
of the servants in the country.  They're a crabby lot.
It seems Mrs. X has taken them into her confidence
regarding a 'danger threatening their master' and they're
all making a great brag of their loyalty, etc.  I don't
think anything can be successfully pulled off up there.
</p>

<p>
"But here's a plan.  Mr. X sleeps in his town house
whenever he is detained late in town.  The house is
closed of course, and is under the care of two old
servants, Tom Monahan and his wife.  I learned that
Tom was a member of the &mdash; district Democratic Club,
and I scraped acquaintance with him there.  We are
now good friends.  I have the entrée to the X house
(when the master is not there) and can describe it to
you fully.
</p>

<p>
"Yesterday I was sitting in the kitchen with the
Monahans, when I noticed that the house in the next
street which backs up against the X house is in the
hands of painters and decorators.  That gave me my
idea.  It would be useless to try to enter the X house
from the front.  Monahan has orders not to admit
any one whatsoever while Mr. X is there.  But there
is a door from the kitchen into the back yard which
is never locked except at night.  I suppose they think
that the high board fence around the yard is sufficient
protection.
</p>

<p>
"When X spends the night in town, Mrs. Monahan
cooks his breakfast for him, and at half past nine (she
is very methodical) carries it up to the dining-room and
puts it on the steam table.  She does not call her
master.  He comes down when he is ready.  Another
thing, Mrs. Monahan does not allow her husband in the
kitchen while she is cooking.  At this hour he will be in
the servants' hall in the front of the basement, reading
the paper.
</p>

<p>
"Here's my plan.  Let your man go to the house
where the painters are at work&mdash;it is No. &mdash; East 65th
Street, and let him ask the boss painter for a job.  The
painters are working on the fourth and fifth floors now.
He'll be turned down of course, or referred to the
office.  Now when he comes down-stairs instead of leaving
the house, let him go into the dining-room to get the
lay of things.  The dining-room is the first floor rear.
The windows overlook the kitchen and dining-room of
the X house.
</p>

<p>
"When he sees Mrs. Monahan go up to the dining-room
with X's breakfast, let him slip down-stairs and
out through the yard of the vacant house.  He will
have a good five minutes or more while Mrs. M is
arranging the things, etc.  He will find plenty of
ladders.  Let him plant a short ladder against the back
fence and drop into the X's yard.  He cannot be seen
from the X house unless Mrs. M just happens to be
at the dining-room window, which is very unlikely.
</p>

<p>
"I will enclose a little plan of the X house.  Your
man enters from the yard by door A, crosses kitchen
and goes out by door Z into passage; opens door C
into housemaid's closet, where he conceals himself until
Mrs. M returns to kitchen.  He then goes up the stairs
D which brings him to the pantry above.  There is a
swing door into the dining-room.  In front of this door
is a tall leather screen.  If he waits behind this screen
until X gets fairly inside the room, he will be between
him and the only exit.  If X is already in the room he
will have him dead to rights.
</p>

<p>
"After the accident the chances of your man making
a getaway are slim.  The entrance hall to the house
lies just in front of the dining-room.  There are two
stairs from the basement.  If Monahan runs up through
the pantry your man may get out by the front door, if
he can open it in time, but if M comes up the front
stairs he will meet him in the hall.  However, I
understood from you that the matter of the getaway was not
of the first importance.
</p>

<p>
"P.S.  I have opened this to add that I have just
learned X is booked to speak at the A.B.A. dinner
at the Astor on Tuesday night.  He will stay in town.
If you think my plan is good enough you'll have to
pull the trick Wednesday morning.  The next time X
stays in town the painters in the vacant house will be
finished."
</p>

<p>
Jack sat scowling at this document.  Another ghastly
assassination scheduled!  His skin crawled with horror.
How to discover the identity of the victim and warn
him in time was the problem.  It was planned for
Wednesday morning&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Jack sprang to his feet electrified.  This
was Wednesday morning.  And it must be about
nine-thirty now!  He pulled out his watch with trembling
fingers.  The hands pointed to twenty minutes past
nine.  He had ten minutes!  And he had yet to find
out whom they planned to kill!
</p>

<p>
He searched frantically among the other papers on
the desk for a possible clue.  He uncovered a card
which had been removed from the index temporarily.
A glance at it was sufficient.
</p>

<p>
DELAMARE, WALTER DE COURCY.
</p>

<p>
Of course!  Delamare had threatened to defy the
blackmailers!  Delamare's house was on the North
side of East Sixty-fourth Street: Delamare had been
the principal speaker at the bankers' dinner the night
before: Jack thought of the man's fine courage, his
humanity, his humor, his unfailing kindness to himself,
and turned sick with horror.
</p>

<p>
"I have not time!" he groaned.
</p>

<p>
He fell on the telephone book.  Delamare's address
was not listed there.  Like many a prominent man he
did not care to subject his home to the annoyance of
calls from cranks and strangers.  It is useless to ask
Information for such numbers.  Jack tried the bank
but it was before the opening hour and he could get
no answer.  Meanwhile the precious moments were
slipping.
</p>

<p>
He snatched up his hat, and ran out of the room careless
if all his work was destroyed, so he might save his
friend.  He had to run half a block before he met a
taxicab.  That took him swiftly enough to Delamare's
house.  The inexpressive blind windows told him
nothing of what was happening within.  It was exactly
nine-thirty when he rang the bell.  He prayed that
Delamare might oversleep to-day.
</p>

<p>
The door was opened by a middle-aged caretaker,
with a somewhat forbidding look, evidently Monahan.
</p>

<p>
"I must see Mr. Delamare at once!" said Jack
breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Not at home.  You'll have to go to his office," was
the stolid response.
</p>

<p>
Jack could stand no more.  "Good God, man!  His
life is threatened.  I must warn him!"
</p>

<p>
Monahan was sure then that he had a crank to
deal with.  He barred the way with his great bulk.
"Take yourself off!" he growled.  "Or I'll call the
police."
</p>

<p>
Jack almost despaired.  "Shut the door and leave
me here if you want," he said, "but for God's sake
go to your master quickly.  Keep him out of the
dining-room until you search it.  There's a murderer hidden
there!"
</p>

<p>
Monahan's mind moved slowly.  He stood staring at
Jack full of sullen suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"Go!  Go!" cried Jack.
</p>

<p>
A shot rang out in the house, seemingly right behind
Monahan.
</p>

<p>
"Too late!" cried Jack.
</p>

<p>
The sound of the shot galvanized the heavy-witted
one into action.  Turning, he ran from the door,
leaving it open.  Jack followed him.  The dining-room as
he already knew adjoined the hall.  As Monahan
opened the door there was flashed on Jack's brain the
picture of a man standing with a gun in his hand, and
another lying face down on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Seize him!" he cried instinctively.
</p>

<p>
But at the sound of their coming, the erect man
turned, and Jack saw that it was Delamare with face
pale but composed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're all right!  Thank God!" cried Jack.
The suddenness of the reaction almost unmanned him.
He had to support himself against the door frame.
</p>

<p>
"You, Robinson?" said Delamare in a low steady
voice.  "Were you warned of this?"
</p>

<p>
"Just ten minutes ago.  I came as quickly as I
could."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know him?" asked Delamare pointing to
the figure on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"I think so.  Turn him over."
</p>

<p>
Monahan obeyed, and as Jack had expected, he saw
the livid, drawn face of the half mad youth he had tried
to befriend.  The eyes were closed.
</p>

<p>
Jack nodded.  "His name is Berg.  Is he dead?"
</p>

<p>
Delamare shook his head smiling.  "Not much.
Stunned only.  I cracked him on the head with his own
gun.  He had no strength."
</p>

<p>
A wave of compassion swept over Jack.  "Poor
devil!  Poor devil!" he murmured.  "He isn't the real
criminal!"
</p>

<p>
"I expect not," said Delamare.
</p>

<p>
Jack suddenly became aware of a dark stain
spreading on Delamare's coat sleeve above the elbow.
"You're wounded!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing serious.  A flesh wound.  I can move my
arm freely."
</p>

<p>
"You must have a doctor."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Monahan, telephone for Doctor
McArdle.  Then for the police."
</p>

<p>
By this time Berg's eyes were open.  He was muttering
incoherently, and rolling his head from side to
side on the floor.  As Monahan was leaving the room,
Jack was struck by an idea.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute!" he said.  To Delamare: "If I
might make a suggestion&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't we keep this affair to ourselves for the
present?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, if it will further your plans."
</p>

<p>
"This young fellow is mad&mdash;or the next thing to it.
If we could put him in the hands of a good brain
specialist, and have his senses restored by proper
treatment, he might make an invaluable witness against the
man we really want."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said Delamare.  "We'll call Doctor Watkins
Kent.  Monahan, never mind the police.  First
call Doctor McArdle, and say I have had a slight
accident.  Say no more than that.  Then call Doctor
Watkins Kent.  Say that Mr. Delamare presents his
compliments, and wants to know if he can make it
convenient to come to his house at once on a matter of
importance."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap34"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Jack, remembering the critical stage at which he
had left matters in Forty-Eighth street, did not
wait for the doctors, but left Berg in Mr. Delamare's
care, and hastened back.  He found that Tommy and
the two plainclothes men had arrived in the meantime,
but finding him gone, they were hanging around
outside the door of the room, at a loss what to do.
</p>

<p>
This time they broke in the door without ado.  At
his first glance inside Jack saw that the room had been
visited.  Though he had been away but little more than
half an hour, a clean sweep had been made of the cards
and papers.  A still smoldering fire in the grate showed
the manner of their disposal.  The window on the
fire escape was open.
</p>

<p>
"He was inside when you got here!" cried Jack.
"He heard you outside.  Now he's given us the slip
again.  Why didn't you watch the back windows!"
</p>

<p>
The city detectives looked distinctly aggrieved.  The
spokesman for the pair said: "How did we know
what your game was?"
</p>

<p>
"You knew!" said Jack to Tommy.
</p>

<p>
Tommy hung his head.  "When I came back, and
found you gone, I didn't know rightly what to do," he
muttered.
</p>

<p>
Jack saw that it was really nobody's fault.  "Oh,
well, we'll have to try again," he said.
</p>

<p>
"You should have called on us sooner," said the
principal detective condescendingly.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, I didn't," said Jack dryly.
</p>

<p>
The other missed the note of irony.  "Well, lay
out your case to us now, and we'll give you some
experienced advice."
</p>

<p>
Somehow the manner of this well-meaning gentleman
did not inspire Jack with overmuch confidence as
to his perspicacity.  Moreover, since his man and his
evidence were both gone, he saw nothing to be gained
by consulting the police.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not quite ready to do that," he said good-naturedly.
"Sorry to have troubled you for nothing."
</p>

<p>
The two detectives exchanged a look of scorn.
"These amateurs think they know it all!" it said.
Only the fact that they knew Jack was a great man's
secretary, and therefore a person to be propitiated,
restrained them from audible comment.
</p>

<p>
However, when they found that Jack was disposed
to reward them liberally, they changed their opinion
of him.  Ten dollar bills are wonderful sweeteners.
</p>

<p>
"How about me?" asked Tommy anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Back to the mines," said Jack.  "In other words,
1118 Broadway."
</p>

<p>
Tommy's face fell piteously.
</p>

<p>
"Mind you," said Jack quickly.  "I'm not blaming
you for our failure.  You did wonderful work.  I'll
send for you when the trail gets hot again."
</p>

<p>
He likewise presented Tommy with a green testimonial
of his appreciation.
</p>

<p>
Before any of them got out of the room the telephone
bell most surprisingly rang.  They all stopped
and stared at the instrument as if they expected an
apparition to issue from the mouthpiece.
</p>

<p>
"Wait!" said Jack.  "Perhaps there's something here."
</p>

<p>
He took down the receiver.  "Hello," he said
ingratiatingly.
</p>

<p>
The reply came in a tone no less dulcet: "How do
you do, Mr. Robinson."
</p>

<p>
Jack almost dropped the receiver.  "Why&mdash;what&mdash;who&mdash;"
he stammered.
</p>

<p>
He heard a light laugh on the wire.  "You are
surprised.  But I was sure I would find you there."
</p>

<p>
"Who is this?" asked Jack sparring for time&mdash;he
knew very well.
</p>

<p>
"Need you ask?" replied the mocking voice.  "This
is the owner of the desk at which you are now seated."
</p>

<p>
Jack said to himself, "Mustn't let him think he's
putting it over you!"  He answered in the same mocking
tone.  "How do you do.  So glad you called me up."
</p>

<p>
Clapping a hand over the transmitter, he whispered
swiftly to the leading detective: "This is the man.
Trace the call back.  If he's anywhere near, get him.
I'll keep him talking."
</p>

<p>
The detective took a note of the number on the
transmitter, and ran out followed by Tommy.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the voice on the wire was saying: "Sorry
I was out when you called."
</p>

<p>
"Very glad to wait until you can get back," said
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"That's nice of you.  But I'm mighty sorry, I've
been called out of town."
</p>

<p>
As on a former occasion Jack's recollection was
vaguely stirred by something familiar in the man's
voice.  He supposed that this was the man who had
appeared as Comrade Wilde the night before, but as
Wilde had not spoken aloud within Jack's hearing, it
must have been on some other occasion he had heard
this voice.  But he could not place it.
</p>

<p>
When the exchange of ironical civilities began to pall,
Jack asked politely: "What can I do for you, Mr. B.?"
</p>

<p>
"I just wanted a little chat with you.  I wanted to
congratulate you on your game."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!"
</p>

<p>
"It's been a mighty interesting game that you and I
have been playing the last few weeks; a sort of chess
game with human pawns, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"That's right."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you've won.  You have checkmated me."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mind telling me what you mean by that
exactly?"
</p>

<p>
"I have quit.  Burned my records as you see; closed
up Anderson and the other agencies; paid off and called
in all my operatives."
</p>

<p>
"Going to retire on your winnings, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," was the calm reply.  "But do me the
credit of believing that it was not the money I was
playing for, but the joy of the game.  It was a great
game!  For three years I have pitted myself single-handed
against the combined wealth of this country.  I
have taken my toll of the millionaires, and not all the
power that wealth commands was able to stop me!"
</p>

<p>
"True enough," said Jack grimly.  "I could admire
you myself, if you had only left murder out of your
calculations."
</p>

<p>
The man at the other end of the wire chose to ignore
the ugly word.  He resumed: "I'm counting on the
fact that your head is strong enough not to be turned
by what I'm telling you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite get you there," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"In other words you're too good a man I hope, to
be unduly puffed up by the fact that I salute you as
the victor, and retire from the game.  You will not
be foolish enough to think that you have me altogether
at your mercy."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I hope I know a good player myself when I
see one."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Then you will be content with your victory,
which I assure you is no mean one for a man of your
years.  So long as you have stopped me you will not
feel that it is necessary to your triumph to have me
apprehended."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I didn't say that," Jack answered quickly.  "I
should have to consider that carefully.  I couldn't
promise anything offhand."
</p>

<p>
"Promise?" said the voice quickly, with a touch of
pique.  "I want no promise.  It is nothing to me
what you decide.  I like you for your sportsmanlike
qualities, and therefore I give you fair warning.  It
is for your own good that I suggest you go no further."
</p>

<p>
"Much obliged," said Jack dryly, "I'll consider it."
</p>

<p>
There was still pique in the voice.  "Don't get a
swelled head, my young friend.  It is fatal to clever
youths.  I've been playing with you the last few weeks.
It amused me to see how near I could let you come to
me, and still evade you.  But if I wished to keep out
of your way, you could never get within miles of me!"
</p>

<p>
"Then why bother about the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I am tired of the chase.  I'm going to
settle down into a nice hum-drum life of respectability.
I'm not going to put myself to the trouble of running
away from you."
</p>

<p>
"And if I should still keep after you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd be awfully sorry," drawled the voice, "but I
should really have to put a quietus on you.  I could,
you know.  I've had a dozen chances within the past
ten days."
</p>

<p>
Jack had no reason to doubt the truth of the last
statement.  He shivered a little.  After all, life was
sweet.
</p>

<p>
"I should hate to do it," the voice went on, "you're
too good a sport."
</p>

<p>
"Much obliged," put in Jack.
</p>

<p>
"But I'd have no choice, really.  I must have rest.
My doctor orders it."
</p>

<p>
Jack smiled grimly at the thought of a crook threatened
with nervous prostration as a result of overwork.
These are rapid times that we live in!  He cast about
in his mind for the means to prolong the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"How do I know you're on the square?" he asked.
"About quitting, I mean."
</p>

<p>
"Go see your friend Anderson to-morrow.  You'll
find him closed up.  Mail your employer's check to the
Eureka Protective Association.  It will be returned
to you by the post-office."
</p>

<p>
It seemed wise to Jack to appear to fall in with the
other's suggestions.  "I appreciate your friendliness in
warning me," he said.  "Do you mind if I ask you a
question or two.  Just natural, human curiosity, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"Ask them and I'll see."
</p>

<p>
"How did you know I had been here in your office
when you came.  I had disturbed nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I was there myself at the time."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!  I made sure of that."
</p>

<p>
The laugh sounded again.  "Nothing is impossible!
Think it over!"
</p>

<p>
"What first put you on to the fact that I was after
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you want to know too much," was the laughing
reply.  "Answer me a question."
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead."
</p>

<p>
"What first made you suspect the Eureka Association?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Gyde left his heir a statement of their dealings
with him."
</p>

<p>
"Hm!  I never thought of that possibility."
</p>

<p>
"Now answer my question."
</p>

<p>
"You'd like to keep me here, wouldn't you, until you
have time to trace this call back, and send a man to
nab me.  Sorry I can't oblige.  I'm at Grand Central
and my train is leaving.  Good-bye!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The detective had not sufficient time, of course, to
get his man.  Oddly enough the humorous "Mr. B"
had told the truth as to where he was.  The call had
come from the Grand Central station.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap35"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Locked in his own room, Jack went over and
over that telephone conversation, regarding it
from every angle, and seeking to establish a new plan
of campaign upon his conclusions.  He was inclined to
believe that "Mr. B" was sincere in his intentions of
quitting the game.  His dealings with the man had
shown him that like all really able liars he used as much
of the truth as he could.  At any rate he would soon
know whether or not he had quit.
</p>

<p>
But that "Mr. B" would now settle down to a life
of respectability, Jack did not credit for a moment.
It was all very well for him to talk about being "tired,"
excitement gets into the blood and one finds onesself
unable to live without it.  The thing was to figure out
in advance what new direction his villainy would take.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the matter in the whole, Jack could not
be very much cast down.  It was no small feat that
he had accomplished in bringing this man to sue for
a truce.  For that's what it was, let him make believe
all he liked.  He, Jack, had stopped him in mid-career,
and Mr. B was no ordinary vulgar crook, but a really
stupendous figure in his way.  And Jack told himself
if he could stop the man, he ought to be able to catch
him.
</p>

<p>
He had not the slightest intention of giving up the
chase, of course.  His adversary's threats had the
effect of stiffening his resolution.  His present problem
was, how to make "Mr. B" think that he had abandoned
all measures against him, while he prepared a
new surprise.  Jack was well assured that he would be
closely watched.
</p>

<p>
Jack's last remaining line of approach to the old man
lay through Miriam.  True, he had said over the
wire that he had called in and paid off all his agents;
but that this applied to Miriam, Jack doubted.
Miriam would never be allowed to enjoy the pickings
of so rich a goose as Bobo was supposed to be, alone.
One way or another demands for money would be
made.  Surely he could find openings here.
</p>

<p>
The one trump card that Jack still held was that
"Mr. B" with all his astuteness still believed that Jack
was an obscure and ambitious youth whose sole motive
in this affair was to make a name for himself.
</p>

<p>
Upon these two facts, the connection between Miriam
and "Mr. B," and the latter's ignorance of his real
identity, Jack built his new plan.  It was inspired by
the old maxim: "Give a thief rope enough and he will
hang himself."  After several hours of hard thought,
he had it roughed out, but one great difficulty remained
to be solved.  Supposing he dropped out of sight for
awhile, how could he inform himself of what went on
in his absence?
</p>

<p>
After lunch Bobo called him up on the long distance.
Bobo and Miriam were honeymooning at Rodney
Farms, that exclusive and extremely expensive country
resort.
</p>

<p>
Bobo's honeymoon was probably not of unalloyed
joy.  His voice was abjectly apologetic.  "That you,
Jack?  How's things?"
</p>

<p>
"Pretty good."
</p>

<p>
The friendliness of Jack's tone heartened the other.
"I just called up to tell you we were coming back
to-morrow for a day or so.  Miriam wants to."
</p>

<p>
"That so?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she fired her maid to-day, and has to get another."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" said Jack with more attention.  Something
stirred in the back of his brain.  "Has she got anybody
in view?"
</p>

<p>
"No, she's going to Miss Staley's Employment
Bureau.  Seems all the women up here get their maids
from her.  Why do you ask?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing."
</p>

<p>
"It's all right for us to come?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I didn't want to take you by surprise."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right.  As it happens, I want to have
a talk with you."
</p>

<p>
Bobo's voice faltered.  "Oh&mdash;! You're not going
to&mdash;&mdash;  You're not going to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," said Jack encouragingly.  "In fact, I
was thinking of loosening the purse strings a bit on
certain conditions."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if you would!  She drives me nearly crazy
with her questions, why I can't get more money."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll talk about it to-morrow&mdash;while Miriam
is out."
</p>

<p>
Jack's next move was to seek out Kate.  To do
this it was necessary to don the Pitman make-up, that
he was heartily sick of now; he vowed it should be
Mr. P.'s final appearance.  He found her in her
little sitting-room, and first he had to tell her of the
exciting events of the morning, concluding with the
astonishing telephone conversation.  Her face blanched
a little, when she heard of the threat.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you are satisfied, aren't you?" she asked in
an offhand tone, "I mean if it's true that he's quit."
</p>

<p>
"Let him get away?" said Jack surprised.  "Oh, Kate!"
</p>

<p>
Kate hung her head blushing.
</p>

<p>
"The point is, are you satisfied to have me stop?"
Jack demanded.  "You know what you said."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you ought to take unnecessary risks,"
she murmured.
</p>

<p>
This was sweet to Jack.  In order to get more of
it he made believe not to see her drift.  "As to that,"
he said carelessly, "the risk is no greater than it's been
right along."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "No, I feel he means what
he says.  It was a warning.  He has a queer sense
of fair play."
</p>

<p>
The enraptured Jack forgot Mr. B. and all else.
"Kitty, do you realize what you're saying!" he cried.
"Do you mean you are satisfied I've done my job,
and are willing to marry me now?  You blessed
darling!  We could get a license this afternoon.  We
don't need any further preparations, do we?  Oh, what
happiness!"
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't marry you at an hour's notice&mdash;or any
man!" said Kate with an indignation, somewhat weakened
by the consciousness of her inconsistency.  "I
need weeks to get ready in!"
</p>

<p>
"Weeks!" echoed Jack with falling countenance.
</p>

<p>
"Well, days, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"But will you, in a week?"
</p>

<p>
"Will you give up the chase of this man?  Turn
your case over to the police now.  After all it's their
business."
</p>

<p>
A reaction took place in Jack.  "Oh, Kitty!" he
said in distress.  "How can I?  All my life I'd feel
as if I'd left my job half finished.  I'd feel as if I'd
been scared off.  How could I respect myself?  How
could you respect me?"
</p>

<p>
She snatched her hand out of his.  At first he
thought he had offended her, but presently he
perceived that she was moved by quite a different feeling.
She was ashamed.  She lifted an humble glance to his.
</p>

<p>
"You're right," she whispered.  "It was just a
moment of weakness.  I wouldn't have let you give it up
really, when I had had time to think.  How will you
be able to respect me now?"
</p>

<p>
He rapturously repossessed himself of her hand.
"Kitty, you silly!  Do you think I will be blaming you
for loving me a little!  How many times have I come
to you ready to give up, and had you send me back
into the fight again!  This just equalizes things a
little."  He smiled at her teasingly.  "You won't be
able to be so superior, that's all!"
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with an odd shy light in her eyes
that he had not seen before.  "You goose!  If you
knew!"
</p>

<p>
"Let's get married anyway," he pleaded.  "There's
no manner of sense in putting it off any longer."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head "No.  We set a task for
ourselves.  Let's accomplish it first."
</p>

<p>
"Well, tell me you love me, and I'll be satisfied."
</p>

<p>
"You know it.  You've always known it."
</p>

<p>
"But tell me in plain downright English."
</p>

<p>
She did.
</p>

<p>
After an interval of divine foolishness, they came
down to earth again, and Jack recollected his new plans.
</p>

<p>
"I've got a difficult and disagreeable job for you,"
said he.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever hear of Miss Staley's Employment
Bureau?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  It's the best-known in town.  All the
fashionable women patronize it."
</p>

<p>
"Miriam's going there to-morrow morning to
engage a maid."
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"I want you to get the job."
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens!  Let me collect my wits!  Lady's
maid, I!"
</p>

<p>
"Look what I've been!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it isn't that I mind!  But could I get away
with it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  She wants a maid to do for her, I
suppose, what you ordinarily do for yourself."
</p>

<p>
"How will I land the job?"
</p>

<p>
"Simply go there and register, and pay the fee, and
turn down any other offers you may get.  I guess they
don't get many applicants that could compete with you."
</p>

<p>
"Silly!  There are references to be thought of."
</p>

<p>
"That's easy.  Mrs. Delamare will provide one,
and get others if necessary."
</p>

<p>
"What is the object of my doing this?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to drop out of sight for a while, and I
must have somebody to keep me informed of what
goes on in Bobo's establishment while I'm away."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  I'll do it."
</p>

<p>
The agreement was sealed.
</p>

<p>
Jack spent the rest of the afternoon in arranging
for the necessary references for Kate, in making certain
inquiries at the steamship offices, and finally in looking
up a friend of the old poverty-stricken days, one Stanley
Larkin.  He chose this friend because of a general
resemblance they were said to bear each other.
</p>

<p>
Larkin worked in the freight office of a railway.  At
the sight of Jack his eyes widened in amazement.
"Good Lord! if it isn't Jack&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Robinson," put in Jack quickly, "for the present."
</p>

<p>
Larkin was anything but slow.  "Sure, Robinson!
It certainly was decent of you to look me up in this hole."
</p>

<p>
"Look here," said Jack, coming to the point at once,
"what kind of a job have you got here?"
</p>

<p>
"Rotten!"
</p>

<p>
"Is there any reason why you shouldn't give it up
for awhile?"
</p>

<p>
"None whatever, if I could meet my board bill
without it."
</p>

<p>
"Will you make a trip down to British Guiana for me?
</p>

<p>
"British Guiana!  Am I dreaming?"
</p>

<p>
"Not that you'd notice," said Jack grinning.  "Boat
leaves Saturday.  I'm going with you part way."
</p>

<p>
The young clerk balanced the stultifying monotony
of life in a railway office against the lure of the tropics.
His eyes became dreamy.  "Will I go!" he said.
"Only give me the chance!  It's like a fairy tale!"
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said Jack.  "Let's have dinner together,
and we'll arrange everything.  It will have to be some
out of the way place because I have to take precautions
against being followed.  Say Pezzi's on West
Thirty-Fourth.  I'll meet you there at seven."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap36"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Bobo and the lovely Miriam arrived at the
Madagascar next morning.  Miriam promptly sallied
forth to Miss Staley's to pick a maid, giving Jack and
Bobo an opportunity to have a long talk undisturbed.
When Bobo learned that Jack's new plans included
unlimited funds for himself for the time being, he
hastened to agree to everything.  Jack rehearsed him
carefully in the part he was to play.  The principal
danger was that Bobo in his enthusiasm might overdo it.
</p>

<p>
"For Heaven's sake don't look so smug and expectant,"
said Jack, "or she'll smell a rat before we
begin!"
</p>

<p>
Bobo, it should be mentioned, knew nothing of the
part Kate was to play.  Bobo had never seen Kate.
</p>

<p>
Miriam returned successful from her quest, and so
far as such a great lady might deign to her slaves,
almost good-tempered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I found a girl," she said languidly.  "Quite a
superior creature.  Her name is Mary Dean.  She
has worked for Mrs. Walter Delamare and Mrs. Willis
Estabrook.  She'll be here with her things in
time to dress me for dinner."
</p>

<p>
Mary Dean was the name chosen by Kate.  "So
far so good," thought Jack.
</p>

<p>
The three of them lunched together in the Dutch
room of their suite.  Bobo as the meal progressed,
became visibly nervous, and scarcely did justice to the
timbales of chicken and asparagus tips.  Jack
watching him, and fearful that Miriam might notice
something, gave him the sign to open the comedy, though
he had intended to wait until after the meal.
</p>

<p>
"I want some more money," said Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" said Miriam scornfully.  "One would think
it was his money you were asking for."
</p>

<p>
This put Bobo out a little; Jack hastened to give him
the next cue.  "But I've been sending you a thousand
a week."
</p>

<p>
"What's a thousand a week!" said Miriam.  "Our
bill at the Rodney Farms was half of that."
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you buy the place?" queried Jack
sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
"Is that for you to say?" demanded Miriam.
</p>

<p>
"I've got to have more!" shouted Bobo&mdash;according
to previous instructions.
</p>

<p>
"A thousand was all you said you wanted."
</p>

<p>
"That was before I married.  I need more now."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and a whole lot more!" put in Miriam.
</p>

<p>
This was just what Jack wanted from her.  He
sought to irritate her still further by addressing
himself pointedly to Bobo.  "You said it was part of my
job to save you from your own extravagance."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't remind me of that now," said Bobo.
"The money's mine, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"You put the management of it in my hands."
</p>

<p>
"Did he engage you as his nurse?" suggested Miriam.
</p>

<p>
"You said I was not to give you any more no matter
how hard you begged for it," said Jack affecting a
stubborn air.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for Heaven's sake!  This is ridiculous!" cried
Miriam.  "Are you compelled to go down on your
knees to beg your own money?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not!" cried Bobo, banging the table.  "I
want money, and I want it quick!"
</p>

<p>
Jack looked more stubborn than ever.  "I'll talk to
you afterwards," he said.  "We can't discuss business
at meals."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, you'd better understand you'll talk
business whenever we want!" said Miriam.
</p>

<p>
Jack frowned.  Still addressing Bobo he said: "We
got along all right till she began to butt in."
</p>

<p>
Miriam turned pale with anger.  This, as Jack intended
it to be, was an outrageous affront to the dignity
she now affected.
</p>

<p>
"Are you&mdash;going to&mdash;sit there&mdash;and let him insult
me!" she stammered to Bobo.
</p>

<p>
Bobo banged the table again.  That table was of
inestimable support to him.  "No, I'm not!  You
apologize to her!"
</p>

<p>
"I won't!" muttered Jack, feigning the sulks.
</p>

<p>
"Apologize to her!" shouted Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I apologize," said Jack gracelessly.
</p>

<p>
"That's no apology!" said Miriam.
</p>

<p>
Jack sprang up and made a sweeping bow, one hand
on his breast.  "I humbly beg your ladyship's pardon,"
he said ironically.
</p>

<p>
Miriam was almost ready to cry now.  "Don't you
see he's insulting me more than ever!"
</p>

<p>
Bobo banged the table again.  "You treat her with
proper respect or I'll fire you!"
</p>

<p>
"You don't dare fire me," said Jack threateningly.
</p>

<p>
Miriam caught him up as quick as lightning.  "Don't
dare fire you!  Why not, I'd like to know!"  Turning
to Bobo: "Has he got something on you?  Is that why
we've had to put up with his cheek all this while!  Oh,
I see it all now!"
</p>

<p>
Jack, while preserving his defiant front, was quivering
with laughter inside.  The thing was working better
than he had dared hope.
</p>

<p>
"What do you care what he's got on you!"
continued Miriam.  "Aren't you worth a hundred
millions?  A millionaire can do anything he wants and
get away with it!"
</p>

<p>
"You're right!" cried Bobo banging the table.  "I'm
tired of having it thrown up to me.  I'm tired of being
under the thumb of my own secretary.  I can do what
I want!  I can spend my money the way I want!
You're fired, do you hear!"
</p>

<p>
Miriam smiled an unpleasant smile.  Her dearest
wish was coming true.
</p>

<p>
Jack made out to be much taken aback.  "You don't
dare," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"We'll see whether I dare!  You pack up your
things and get out before night, see?  I'll pay you a
month's salary to be rid of you!"
</p>

<p>
"I won't go," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Then you'll be thrown out!" said Miriam.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell what I know!"
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead and tell it," said Bobo.  "I'm sick of
hearing about it!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell her!"
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," said Miriam.  "I guess I can stand it."
</p>

<p>
"When we worked in the sash and blind factory
together," said Jack with the air of one delivering
damning evidence, "he used to swipe his lunch money out of
the petty cash, and make phony entries in the cash book
to hide it.  I caught him at it!"
</p>

<p>
Bobo hung his head in simulated shame.  It was
good comedy.
</p>

<p>
Miriam shouted with laughter.  "Is that all!"  To
Bobo: "You poor idiot!  Do you mean to say that
was all he had over you to set him up so!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've fired him, haven't I?" said Bobo with an
aggrieved air.  To Jack he added: "Now you've done
your worst, get!"
</p>

<p>
Jack put on an air of swaggering bravado.  "Oh,
all right!  I'm sick of the job anyhow!  I wouldn't
work for you now for ten times the salary!"
</p>

<p>
Miriam laughed insultingly.
</p>

<p>
Jack arose.  He still had to make a good exit.  "It's
hard enough to take all the work and the responsibility,"
he said with assumed bitterness, "but when
your boss marries a&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You'll leave her out of it, or I'll smash you!" cried
Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Come on!  Let's settle it man to man," said Jack.
"I'm ready any time!"
</p>

<p>
"You get out of here!" shouted Bobo.  "Or I'll
call the house detective!"
</p>

<p>
Jack went, slamming the door.  He proceeded to
his own room, chuckling.
</p>

<p>
Later, while he was packing, he heard a timid knock.
Bobo was standing outside with a deprecating air.
</p>

<p>
"Can I come in?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure!  Where's Miriam?"
</p>

<p>
"We're safe.  She's gone out to see about getting
me another secretary."
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed.  "Poor Bobo!"
</p>

<p>
"It went off all right," said Bobo.  "She doesn't
suspect a thing!"
</p>

<p>
"Fine!" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Take a little trip.  British Guiana.  Boat leaves
Saturday."
</p>

<p>
"Lucky Dog!"
</p>

<p>
"What, already!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was my fate, I suppose."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap37"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Jack was counting on the fact that the circumstances
of his quarrel with Bobo would be faithfully
reported to "Mr. B." and that the latter would
satisfy himself that he, Jack, actually boarded the
steamship for British Guiana.
</p>

<p>
He moved to a more modest hotel, as befitted his
altered circumstances, but on Saturday morning he
returned to the Madagascar and loitered in the lobby,
ostentatiously bidding good-by to the acquaintances he
had made there, whose demeanor, by the way, had
noticeably cooled since he lost his job.  He did not
see Bobo again, but he had a distant glimpse of Kate
passing through the lobby, a charming figure in her
maid's dress with lace apron and cap, her eyes
demurely cast down.
</p>

<p>
Jack had the satisfaction, at length, of observing
that he was the object of a covert interest on the part
of a well-dressed, sharp-eyed youth of much the same
type as those he had formerly known in "Mr. B.'s"
service.  When he was sure of this he took a taxi for
the boat.  Baldwin, who seemed to have a genuinely
friendly feeling for him, offered to see him off, and
Jack was not averse, of course, to having another
witness to his actual departure.
</p>

<p>
As he and Baldwin stood on the promenade deck of
S.S. <i>Covenas</i> Jack saw the sharp-eyed one watching
from the crowd on the dock.  Evidently his instructions
were to make sure that Jack did not escape down
the gang-plank at the last moment.  Stanley Larkin
was safely aboard the ship, but according to
pre-arrangement he and Jack gave no sign of recognition.
</p>

<p>
Finally the last gong sounded, Jack and Baldwin
parted, the whistle blew, and the <i>Covenas</i> started to
back slowly out into midstream.  On her printed
passenger list appeared the names of Mr. Stanley Larkin,
bound for St. Thomas, her first port of call, and
Mr. John Robinson, booked through to Georgetown,
British Guiana.  Both young gentlemen were aboard, as
we have seen, but as a matter of fact they had changed
tickets&mdash;and identities for the voyage.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Of that pleasant voyage it is unnecessary to speak,
since nothing occurred upon it that bears upon this
story.  Jack, that is to say the real Jack, went ashore
at the island of St. Thomas, where, under the name of
Larkin, he booked passage back to New York on the
<i>Lobos</i>, first returning steamer of the same line.
</p>

<p>
In St. Thomas he received a cablegram, which read,
when decoded:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Still holding my job.  Nothing new.  Love.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
KATE.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In seventeen days from the time he left he was off
quarantine again.  According to an arrangement
effected through Mr. Delamare's good offices, the health
officer's boat took Jack off the <i>Lobos</i> and landed him
on Staten Island, whence he made his way via Elizabeth
to Newark without setting foot on Manhattan.
This was in case the astute "Mr. B" should take it
into his head to have the <i>Lobos</i> watched when she
docked.
</p>

<p>
Jack went to a hotel in Newark, where it had been
arranged he was to receive Kate's reports.  He found
awaiting him a day by day account of the life of Bobo's
household which did credit to Kate's faculty of
observation.  It contained, however, no suggestion of what he
so much wished to find, the reëntrance of "Mr. B"
upon the scene.  Only a few characteristic excerpts
from Kate's reports need be given.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
November 25th: Miriam has embarked on a perfect
orgy of spending.  All day long, dresses, furs, hats are
being delivered at the hotel, not to speak of the dozens
of expensive, useless knickknacks that catch her eye
in the stores.  It is part of my duty to unwrap the
packages.  Lots of the things she never even looks at
when they get home.  She buys, I am sure, largely for
the pleasure of seeing the salespeople fawn when she
gives her name and address.  It is a never-failing
pleasure to her to announce who she is.  Sometimes
she takes me with her on a shopping expedition because
she thinks I lend style to the outfit.  She talks French
to me in public.  Such French!  She bought an
automobile to-day, a Vickers-Lee landaulet, price $8,000.
She intends to have two men on the box, when she can
get their liveries made.  A man from Mercer's, the
fashionable jewelers, brought an amazing array of
pearls and diamonds to the hotel this afternoon.  She
chose a strand of pearls.  I don't know the price.
Such unbridled extravagance outrages my New England
conscience.  I hope you'll be able to put a stop
to it soon.

<p>
Nov. 27th: M.'s heart is set on having a mansion on
upper Fifth avenue, whence she can institute a social
campaign.  When she is not at the dressmaker's she is
being taken around to see such places.  The servility
of the well-dressed young real estate agents delights
her.  She gives Bobo no peace on the subject, but I
believe he has avoided committing himself as yet.  As
she has me fussing over her clothes or her hair almost
every moment that she is at home, I hear most of their
conjugal discussions.
</p>

<p>
Nov. 28th: The new secretary came to-day.  I
dislike him intensely.  His name is Leroy Chalfonte.
He is a handsome young fellow in a brutal, scornful
way, the type that makes fools of many silly women.
His manners are superficially good enough, but he
doesn't trouble to hide the sneer.  I gather that he
and Miriam spend the afternoons in the tango parlors.
He is covertly insolent to Bobo, who dares not call
him down.

<p>
Dec. 5th: This is no easy job to hold.  M.'s method
with servants seems to be that of certain misguided
parents with their offspring.  I believe it is called
"breaking their spirit."  When she gets up in a bad
temper, positively nothing that I can do pleases.  The
more patient and willing I am, the greater offense it
is.  I have found it better to be a little impudent at
such times.  She expects it, and she can then abuse me
with a better face.  Sometimes I am sorry for the poor
creature.  She has never known a moment's real
happiness, I am sure.  You would think that now she would
feel as if her ambition was realized, but no!  Mercer's
have a pearl necklace worth a hundred and fifty
thousand, and she can think of nothing else.  I hope you
have taken precautions against Bobo's attempting to
gratify any such whim.

</p>

<p>
Dec. 11th: Yesterday Miriam had a talk with
somebody over the telephone.  She used the instrument in
her boudoir.  I had a perfectly natural excuse to enter
the room while she was talking, but she ordered me
out.  I made out this much.  That somebody was
insisting on something that she objected to&mdash;somebody
that she was in awe of.  Thinking perhaps of the
danger of somebody listening in, she made a date to
continue the talk from an outside 'phone.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This last entry on Kate's report was dated only the
day before.  Since her communication gave Jack nothing
to go on, all he could do was to wait until he heard
from her again.  She would learn of the arrival of the
<i>Lobos</i> from the newspapers, and would without doubt
call him up at his hotel at the first opportunity.
</p>

<p>
At nine o'clock that night Jack got his call, and heard
the voice that was dearest to him.
</p>

<p>
"Jack!"
</p>

<p>
"Kitty, dearest!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear, it's so good to hear you!  Are you
quite well?"
</p>

<p>
"Right as a trivet!  And you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm well.  But I can't stand that woman much
longer!"
</p>

<p>
"Poor Kitty!  I know.  Where are you 'phoning from?"
</p>

<p>
"Booth in a drug-store."
</p>

<p>
"Is it safe?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!  They've gone to the theater, and to
dance afterwards.  They won't be home until three
or after.  She insists on my staying up to put her to
bed, but they know I go out while they're out."
</p>

<p>
"Have you any news for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think I have."
</p>

<p>
"Shoot!"
</p>

<p>
"You remember in my last letter I said Miriam had
had a telephone conversation yesterday that seemed
to agitate her?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think I have the explanation.  Last night
when I was putting my lady to bed&mdash;Oh, my dear,
you'll never know what I have been through!&mdash;Bobo
said, apropos of nothing, but only anxious to propitiate
her, 'It will be nice to have some relations, won't
it?'  Miriam replied ill-temperedly: 'I'm not so crazy about
it.'  'What's Uncle George like?' asked Bobo.  'Just a
business man,' she answered, 'a manufacturer of stoves
or something.'  'Well fixed?' asked Bobo.  'He must
be or he couldn't have retired,' she answered."
</p>

<p>
Kate went on: "Well, Uncle George and Aunt Sally
turned up for lunch to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" said Jack.  "What's he like?"
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't fit the descriptions of 'Mr. B.'"
</p>

<p>
"He wouldn't!  Go on."
</p>

<p>
"He's a man of fifty-odd, bald, dean-shaven, blue
eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Short and stocky?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"So far so good.  Go on."
</p>

<p>
"He was very jolly and good-natured; full of jokes:
courteous to everybody, even to me.  Just the same,
Miriam is afraid of him.  She is quite subdued when
he is there."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  We're getting warm.  What's Aunt Sally like?"
</p>

<p>
"How do you describe an old lady?  She's just like
another.  She probably set up to be a belle in her
youth, because she still wears a false front.  She's very
quiet.  Uncle George talks all the time, and she just
listens and nods and smiles.  It appears they live in
Buffalo and have come to New York for a little gayety.
They wanted to see dear Miriam's husband, of course,
so they looked her up at once.  They're staying at the
Hotel Abercrombie, but have decided to move to the
Madagascar to be nearer dear Miriam."
</p>

<p>
"What's your opinion, Kitty?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not dead certain yet.  The most suspicious
thing is Miriam's attitude.  Why should she be in such
awe of her agreeable uncle?  That they have not seen
each other for years, as they give out, is certainly false.
One of Uncle's features fits all the descriptions of
'Mr. B.' that we have received.  His piercing blue
eyes&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said Jack.  "That's the one feature he
couldn't change."
</p>

<p>
"If we were not looking for 'Mr. B.' to appear on
the scene, and did not know that he was fiendishly
clever, I must say I would never suspect Uncle George.
He plays his part to perfection.  He lets on to be a
prosperous man, and asks no favors of Bobo.  I
gather that he insists on paying his half everywhere.
But to-day I got a hint of his possible game.  He and
Bobo had a long talk in the Dutch room.  I made an
excuse to pass through as often as I could, and picked
up some scraps of their conversation."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Jack eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle George was posing as an experienced and
successful man of affairs, see?  Without appearing to
pry into Bobo's business, he was setting himself to win
his confidence in such matters.  Bobo is obviously
such a fool that Uncle George no doubt anticipates
gaining a complete ascendancy over him, and perhaps
sees himself in the position of directing all Bobo's
affairs.  But he's an artist; he carries it off so well, I
find myself wondering sometimes if my suspicions
aren't all imaginary."
</p>

<p>
"We'll make sure of that," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want me to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Get me a scrap of his writing if you can&mdash;to
compare with what I have."
</p>

<p>
"I'll try."
</p>

<p>
"And call me up again first chance you get."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>
The following day was a hard one on Jack, for he
had to pass it in inaction and suspense.  He
thought it wiser not to venture over to New York: an
awkward chance encounter might spoil all.  He talked
to Mr. Delamare over the 'phone, and through him got
into communication with the Deputy Commissioner of
police.  The latter promised him whatever help he
needed, which was certainly good-natured, since, at
Jack's invitation, his men had twice assisted in a fiasco.
</p>

<p>
Kate called him up at the same hour as on the day
before.
</p>

<p>
"They're off for the night again.  All four of them."
</p>

<p>
"Anything decisive to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"No, but many little things have confirmed me in my
opinion that Uncle George is our man.  He is no less
agreeable than at first, but in a curious way I feel his
power stealing over us.  They have moved to the
Madagascar, and have been with us all day.  We are
already as intimate as possible.  Bobo is more friendly
to them than their supposed niece.  She was in a grinding
temper last night after they had gone, and properly
threw things about."
</p>

<p>
"To-day, I fancy, Uncle George must have found an
opportunity to give her a call, for she was much
chastened.  It is a strange and welcome sight to see
somebody who can tame her.  I could almost like this
old man if it were not for some things.  He's so sensible!
Perhaps that's why he was successful for so long.
A sensible crook must be a novelty."
</p>

<p>
"It is," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"To-day they have had all their meals in our rooms.
They make me wait on them, because they say I am
handier than the men waiters&mdash;'and much nicer to look
at,' adds Uncle George."
</p>

<p>
"Confound him!" muttered Jack.
</p>

<p>
"I don't object to the waiting, of course, for it gives
me a chance to hear the table conversation.  It is like
a comedy.  To-day Bobo made a joking reference to
the hundred and fifty thousand dollar necklace that
Miriam's heart was set on.  The old man just looked
at her with those icy blue eyes, and she hung her head.
The necklace has not been mentioned since.
</p>

<p>
"Another thing, Uncle George was responsible for
firing Chalfonte to-day.  Apparently Chalfonte can't
be a member of the gang, but a private friend of
Miriam's.  At any rate his doom was sealed from the
moment Uncle George turned up.  He was insolent
at the table in his usual way, and, backed up by Uncle,
Bobo fired him on the spot.  Miriam couldn't say a
word.  Bobo is beginning to think Uncle George is
the most wonderful man on earth.
</p>

<p>
"'What do you want a secretary for, anyway,' Uncle
said to Bobo.
</p>

<p>
"Bobo stammered something about knowing nothing
about business.
</p>

<p>
"'Pshaw!' said Uncle in his hearty way.  'If you
want any advice come to me!'"
</p>

<p>
"Did you get a sample of his handwriting?" asked
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, by great good luck.  I didn't see how I was
going to manage it.  But he wrote a note in our rooms
to-day.  I was hoping he might give it to me to post,
but he didn't.  However, there was a new blotter on
the desk, which took a perfect impression of several
lines that he wrote.  I have just mailed you the blotter.
Hold it up to a mirror.  The note you see is just a
bit of camouflage.  He is enclosing a subscription to
the Buffalo Express."
</p>

<p>
"What about their arrangements for to-morrow?"
asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"I can only tell you about lunch.  I know that Uncle
George and Aunt Sally are coming to lunch in our
rooms because I heard Bobo giving a special order
over the 'phone."
</p>

<p>
"What time?"
</p>

<p>
"One o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  If the handwriting matches up, you
may expect us about that time."
</p>

<p>
"Heavens!  How my heart beats when I think of it!"
</p>

<p>
"You needn't be there if you'd rather not."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't miss it for a farm!"
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Then you can give me a signal.  When
they are all seated at the table, come down to the door
of Silas Gyde's sitting-room and tap three times.  On
your way back leave the doors open behind you."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Jack possessed three letters in "Mr. B.'s" own hand;
that which had fallen on the table in the Alpine Heights
restaurant; that which he had found pinned to Bobo's
overcoat; and that which had been handed to
Mrs. Cleaver in the Hotel Bienvenu.  The same hand had
likewise kept the card index system.  It was a hand
of strong individuality, the letters quaintly formed as
in antique script, suggesting an orderly, painstaking and
somewhat vain character in the writer, who must have
gone to no end of trouble to form such a hand in youth.
</p>

<p>
The piece of blotting paper arrived in the first mail
next morning.  Held up before a mirror, a single glance
was sufficient to identify it.  There were the same
quaint and artistic characters&mdash;unmistakable!
</p>

<p>
Jack hesitated no longer.  He took the first train
for Manhattan, and had himself carried to police
headquarters in a taxi.  To the Deputy Commissioner Jack
now told sufficient of his tale to enlist his interest, but
withheld the whole, for fear that the official's natural
amazement and incredulity might hold things up.  The
Deputy was satisfied that the genuine John Farrow
Norman stood before him, and that was sufficient.
Mr. Delamare vouched for it.
</p>

<p>
Jack asked for eight men, and they were sent for.
In the commissioner's office he described to them the
man he wanted, and gave his offense as blackmail.  A
capable sergeant was in charge of the squad.  They
were to proceed to the Madagascar separately.  Four
of his men he instructed to wait in the street, in case
an escape should be attempted from the windows of
the state suite.  The sergeant and the other three would
assemble in Connolly's room at the hotel and wait
until they got word from Jack.  Connolly was well known
to the sergeant.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Delamare was anxious to be "in at the death,"
as he put it, but they persuaded him to wait, and
appear on the scene a little later.
</p>

<p>
Shortly before one o'clock Jack approached the
Madagascar on foot from the direction of Eighth
avenue.  He had had himself set down at the corner,
because he thought a taxicab might possibly attract
attention in the unfrequented side street.  He let
himself in by the private entrance leading to Silas Gyde's
old rooms.  When he was "fired" he had taken the
precaution of retaining a set of keys.
</p>

<p>
Here he waited, pacing up and down the little
sitting-room watch in hand.  The minutes passed with
leaden slowness.  He reflected on how much had
happened since first he had entered that room with beating
heart.  No detail of the room was changed: the same
expensive furnishings which somehow only created a
barren effect&mdash;even the kerosene lamp and the heater
were still there.
</p>

<p>
Like all imaginative men on the eve of a decisive
action, he became a prey to the blackest forebodings.
He remembered how often before the old man had
fooled him, when he all but had his hand on him.  No
doubt his infernal luck would still serve him.  They
would have changed their plans, and gone out to lunch;
or some one had tipped him off&mdash;he had his spies out;
or his sharp eyes had marked the detectives arriving in
the lobby.
</p>

<p>
In the very midst of these depressing fancies Jack
heard the agreed signal, three taps on the door.
</p>

<p>
A swift reaction passed over him.  His spirits soared.
"Kitty has not failed me!  Everything is all right!"
he thought.
</p>

<p>
He called up the office, and asked for Mr. Connolly.
Getting him on the wire, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Connolly, have you got four men there, waiting
for instructions?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."  The house detective had no idea who
was speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Well, just tell them to take their places."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
Jack waited two minutes to give the plainclothes
men time to get upstairs.  He was thinking: "After all
this time, and all these failures, in a minute I shall be
actually face to face with him!"
</p>

<p>
He opened the door into the hotel corridor.  Four
steps away the door into the end room of the state
suite stood ajar.  Down the corridor he saw the four
detectives taking their places.  One was approaching
to guard the door by which he entered.
</p>

<p>
Jack passed quickly and noiselessly through the
lower rooms of the suite.  In the pocket of his coat he
grasped his automatic.  He approached the Dutch room
through Miriam's "boudoir" since Kate had left the
doors open that way.  He came upon Kate in this
room, standing by a window with her hands pressed
tight to her breast to control her agitation.  From the
Dutch room adjoining came the sound of light talk
and laughter.
</p>

<p>
In passing, Jack touched Kate's cold hand to
reassure her&mdash;and opened the door.  The cheerful
sounds of the luncheon party rushed to meet them.  He
saw the four at the small table.  Bobo was facing him
and the bald-headed man was opposite Bobo.  Miriam
had her back to the windows, and the little old woman
faced her.
</p>

<p>
At the opening of the door Miriam turned her head.
She was in the act of saying: "Mary, where have you
been?" when she saw who it really was, and stopped
on a gasp.  Bobo looked up and saw, too.
</p>

<p>
"J-Jack!" he stammered.
</p>

<p>
With astonishing swiftness the bald-headed man
leaped up, knocking his chair over backwards, and,
never looking round, ran with head down for the door
on the left.  This led to the foyer and the main
entrance to the suite.  The detectives were out there, and
Jack let him go.  The old lady had covered her face
with her hands.  Bobo sat like a stone man staring at
Jack.
</p>

<p>
All this happened in a breath.  Miriam had sprung
up too, and backed away from the table towards the
windows.  As Jack came further into the room, she
suddenly darted behind him into her own room.
</p>

<p>
Jack was standing listening for sounds from the
corridor, when suddenly Kate screamed a warning behind
him.  He instinctively relaxed, dropping to the floor.
There was a shot.  The bullet passed about where his
head had been, and broke a tankard on the plate rail
across the room.  From the floor Jack saw the two
women struggling for possession of the gun.  Springing
to Kate's aid, he disarmed Miriam.  She retreated to
the farthest corner of the room, panting and snarling
like an animal.
</p>

<p>
The sounds from outside were reassuring.  There
was a scuffle and the bald-headed man was pushed back
into the room by two detectives.  He still had his head
down, but as he came opposite Jack he suddenly raised
it with cool and smiling effrontery.  It was Jack's turn
to be dumbfounded.
</p>

<p>
"Harmon Evers!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed the philosophic little wig-maker.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>
Jack stared at his adversary open-mouthed.  He
required an appreciable time to adjust himself to
the situation.  His face turned grim&mdash;but he could see
the joke on himself too.
</p>

<p>
"No wonder you were on to every move I made
when I went to you for my disguises!"
</p>

<p>
"Humorous situation, wasn't it?" said Evers mockingly.
</p>

<p>
"Was it accident?" demanded Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!  I willed you to come to me!"
</p>

<p>
Jack recollected the boy who had first given him
Evers' name.
</p>

<p>
By this time Miriam had recovered her self-possession.
She came out of her corner.  Addressing the
detective sergeant, she said haughtily: "What is the
meaning of this outrage?  This"&mdash;pointing to
Bobo&mdash;"is Mr. John Farrow Norman, and I am Mrs. Norman.
The gentleman you have your hand on is my
uncle, George Culbreth.  You shall pay dearly for
this!"
</p>

<p>
She carried conviction.  The two detectives looked
uneasy.  But Jack's amused smile reassured them a
little.
</p>

<p>
"This guy was trying to beat it," the sergeant said.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose he was going for assistance," said Miriam
quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what did you shoot for?"
</p>

<p>
"I shot as I would shoot at any intruder into my
rooms.  Take your hands off that gentleman!  I
demand an explanation!"
</p>

<p>
Evers was staring at the ceiling with his head cocked
quizzically.  He seemed the least concerned person in
the room.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant nodded towards Jack.  "We're under
his orders, Miss.  You'll have to ask him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know him!" she cried.  "A discharged
servant of my husband's!  He's capable of laying any
charge out of spite!  You'd better be careful how
you believe him!"  She whirled on Kate.  "And this
woman!  She let him in!  Another unfaithful servant!
A nice thing it is when people like us are at the mercy
of their servants!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dry up, my dear!" said Evers in a weary voice.
"You mean well, but the game is up!"
</p>

<p>
But Miriam had acquired too much momentum to
be stopped right away.  "I demand that the
management be sent for!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"It is not necessary," said Jack.  He had caught
sight of Mr. Delamare entering from the corridor.
"Here is some one who will identify me.  Tell her
first, who this is."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Walter Delamare," said the sergeant with
unction.
</p>

<p>
Miriam, seeing the smile of confidence exchanged
by Delamare and Jack, felt the ground slipping from
under her feet.  Her face blanched.  "Well, anyway
I am Mrs. Norman," she cried.  "Nothing can change
that!"
</p>

<p>
"Tell them all who I am, please," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Delamare put a hand on Jack's shoulder.  "This is
my good friend, Jack Norman," he said.  "The late
Silas Gyde's sole heir."
</p>

<p>
Evers' face betrayed no change.  Perhaps his
intuition had warned him of what was coming.  Not so
Miriam.  A queer gasping cry escaped her.
</p>

<p>
"Then who&mdash;who is this?" she stammered, pointing
to Bobo.  "And who am I?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know the young man's right name.  Mr. Norman
engaged him to impersonate him, in order to
free his hands while he was engaged in running down
the murderers of Silas Gyde."
</p>

<p>
Miriam's proud figure sagged.  No further sound
escaped her.  All the color left her face.  She looked
old and haggard.  Kate thought she was about to fall,
and made a step towards her.  Miriam stiffened with
hate, and Kate fell back.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do with this man?" asked the sergeant.
</p>

<p>
"Take him to headquarters," said Jack.  "Watch
him well.  You've got the cleverest crook in America
there."
</p>

<p>
"Much obliged for the compliment," said Evers
coolly.  "May I speak to you a moment, alone, before
they take me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Jack, no!" Kate cried involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
Jack silenced her with a smile.  "Search him for
weapons," he said.
</p>

<p>
The detectives frisked their captive efficaciously.
Nothing more dangerous than a pen-knife was revealed.
</p>

<p>
"Go into the front room," Jack said to Evers.  "No
use trying a window, because there are four more
men in the street."  He motioned to the detectives to
remain at the doors.  He followed Evers.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of the gaudy blue salon Evers turned
with his queer smile.  "I suppose you don't want to
shake hands with me."
</p>

<p>
Jack was nonplussed.  He felt that he had no business
to be liking the man and yet&mdash;he did.  "One must
draw the line somewhere," he muttered.  "After all
you murdered my benefactor."
</p>

<p>
Evers was not in the least put out.  "Oh, come!
Looking at it from a disinterested point of view, old
Silas Gyde was not much of a loss to the community,
was he?  And he wasn't your benefactor until I put
him out of the way."
</p>

<p>
"I can't argue that with you," said Jack stiffly.
"Murder is murder!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, let it pass," said Evers.  "That isn't what
I wanted to talk to you about.  It's my old lady out
there.  I swear to you on my honor&mdash;such as it is,
that she never knew what I was up to.  She thought
it was smuggling, and no woman considers smuggling
a crime, you know.  She's sixty-three years old and
has a heart complaint.  Let her go."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I'll do what I can," said Jack, more and more
uncomfortable.  "But I can't tell what the trial may
bring out."
</p>

<p>
"There won't be any trial," said Evers quietly.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;&mdash;!  You mean&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
Evers merely smiled.
</p>

<p>
Jack half turned as if to call for help.
</p>

<p>
"Wait!" said Evers sharply.  "Didn't I give you a
good run for your money?" he went on with a genuine
note of appeal.  "And you've won.  Can't you afford
to be generous?  Don't interfere.  Let me pay my
forfeit in my own way.  The trouble with me was, I
couldn't endure the tedium of a respectable life.  But
I am no quitter.  I went into this with my eyes open,
knowing the penalty.  I was prepared to pay it at any
moment."
</p>

<p>
"I won't interfere," said Jack in a low tone.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  One thing more."  He held out two
keys and a scrap of paper.  "These keys are for my
box in the Windsor Safe Deposit Vaults.  Number
and password are written on the paper.  Everything
I own is in the box.  My wife is provided for with
an annuity.  There are securities to the amount
of&mdash;Oh, I don't know, half a million, maybe.  You can't
return it because the records of whom I obtained it
are burned.  But take it and do some good act.  Build
a home for indigent millionaires&mdash;or anything you
like."
</p>

<p>
In spite of himself Jack had to smile.
</p>

<p>
"Come on now.  Hand me back to the bulls."
</p>

<p>
In the adjoining room Evers was handcuffed and
marched out between two detectives.  The old lady
picked up her hat and coat, and silently followed them.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant nodded towards Miriam.  "How
about her?"
</p>

<p>
Jack hung in indecision.
</p>

<p>
"She tried to plug you, didn't she?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't mind a little thing like that."
</p>

<p>
The worthy sergeant looked a trifle scandalized at
the jest.
</p>

<p>
Bobo, who had sat in a daze throughout, lifted a
drawn face.  "Jack, let her go, please!" he murmured
huskily.
</p>

<p>
Jack looked at Kate, and she nodded imperceptibly.
</p>

<p>
"Only the one prisoner, sergeant!" said Jack.  "I
haven't evidence enough against this one."
</p>

<p>
Delamare, shaking Jack's hand, went with the sergeant,
and the two young couples were left alone.  An
awkward silence fell on them.  Jack was afraid to say
anything for fear of seeming to triumph over them.
Kate signaled to him that the best thing for them to
do was to go.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute," said Jack.  He turned to the other
man with a humorous light in his eye.  "Bobo, you
and I have been partners in a hazardous enterprise.
I can't say exactly that you have always stood by me,
but there were extenuating circumstances.  And I feel
a certain responsibility in introducing you to a life of
luxury.  So I'm going to establish a trust fund that will
pay you twenty-five thousand a year.  With care, you
and Miriam ought to be able to live on that."  He
turned to the girl.  "Will you stick to him, Miriam?
You might do worse.  He loves you.  It's the real
thing&mdash;and that's not too common in this wicked world."
</p>

<p>
Bobo got up.  "Miriam!" he said imploringly.  He
took her hand.  She did not pull it away.
</p>

<p>
"Now, come on, Kate!" said Jack briskly.  "Never
mind any things!"
</p>

<p>
He led her down the corridor to Silas Gyde's old
rooms.  "We'll go through the vault into your house,"
he said.  "The hotel lobby will be seething with
excitement by now."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if you did right&mdash;about Bobo and
Miriam, I mean.  She isn't likely to do him much
good."
</p>

<p>
"Such as she is, he'd rather have her than anything
else in the world."
</p>

<p>
In Kate's house they paused.
</p>

<p>
"What are we going to do now?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"First I'm going to kiss you," he said, suiting the
action to the word.  "Then you're going to put on your
prettiest dress and hat and we're going down to the
City Hall to get a license.  Then we'll be married by
the first person that's looking for the job.  Then we'll
take a train for Charleston where the <i>Columbian</i> is still
awaiting orders, and we'll sail away under the tropical
moon with a whole ocean liner to our two selves!"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"But me no buts!"
</p>

<p>
"But you'll have to be here for the trial, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"There won't be any trial," said Jack gravely.
"Harmon Evers had a vial of cyanide in his vest
pocket."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried Kate.  "He must be stopped!"
</p>

<p>
"I promised not to."
</p>

<p>
"But is it right to let him cheat the law?"
</p>

<p>
"He may cheat the law, but not justice!  The state
will be saved the expense of a trial, and the public a
demoralizing newspaper sensation."

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

cannot be read by your equipment.

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
